This troubleshooting guide is mostly for data stewards. It is not a git tutorial, but rather a small start.

## ARCitect â€“ first aid checklist

This checklist should help to identify common issues with an ARC.
It may help data stewards and users to identify the overall status of the ARC and a user's setup.

### Git installation

Check whether git and git-lfs are installed and executable.

<Steps>

1. Open command line via ARCitect --> Tools --> Command Window
2. Type and execute `git --version` and `git-lfs --version`

</Steps>

If instead of showing the versions for both tools this returns an error, something may be wrong with the Git installation or [storage location of the ARC](#storage).

### Commits

Check commits and compare those of the local ARC vs. the ARC in the DataHUB.

<Steps>

1. Local: ARCitect --> History Menu
2. DataHUB: ARC --> right sidebar --> *Number of* Commits

</Steps>

The commits (incl. commit message, date and committer details) in the DataHUB should be the same as in the local ARC. 
If not, this might help to identify at what time point (i.e. between which commits) something unexpected happened.

### Size

Check the ARC size and compare that of the local ARC vs. the ARC in DataHUB.

<Steps>

1. Local: Open the ARC folder via ARCitect --> Explorer. Right-click the folder name and inspect the size via `Properties` (Windows) or `Get Info` (macOS)
2. DataHUB: ARC --> right sidebar --> Project storage

</Steps>

Note, that the size of your local ARC is approximately double the size of that in the DataHUB. This is due to git's version control mechanism.
If the size is very different, the ARC synchronization was likely not successful.

### Large files

Check whether large files are properly uploaded into LFS.

<Steps>

   1. Local: Inside ARCitect, large files should be flagged with `LFS` in the file tree
   2. DataHUB:
      - ARC --> right sidebar --> Project storage: The size of `LFS` should be high, that of `Repository` should be low
      - Just like in ARCitect, large files should be flagged with `LFS` in the file tree

</Steps>

If large files are unexpectedly not flagged as LFS, please check the [details on Git-LFS](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/git/git-lfs/) and some trouble shooting in [the section below](#git-lfs).

### Remote

Check the remote connection. 

<Steps>
    1. ARCitect --> DataHUB sync --> Remote
</Steps>

Make sure, that the remote URL is correct and aligns with that of the ARC in the DataHUB.
This may not be the case, if the local ARC's folder name was changed or if the ARCs URL in the DataHUB has changed to moving the ARC or adapting the URL. 

:::tip
For large file upload, the selected remote should contain a token indicated by the key icon.
:::

### Branch

Check the current branch.

<Steps>
    1. ARCitect --> Commit Menu --> Dropdown "Branch"
</Steps>

For most use cases, the `main` branch should be selected.
If the branch dropdown does not display `main`, something may be wrong with the status of your ARC. Please contact a data steward for help. 

### Status

Check the current git status.

<Steps>
   1. Open ARC in a command line via ARCitect --> Tools --> Command Window
   2. Run `git status`
</Steps>

See [Git status](#git-status) for details.

### Config

Check the git configuration

<Steps>
   1. Open ARC in a command line via ARCitect --> Tools --> Command Window
   2. Run `git config --list`
</Steps>

See [Git config](#git-configuration) for details.

### Gitignore

Check whether a `.gitignore` file exists in the ARC. 
If no `.gitignore` exists, this can lead to unexpected behavior for temporary, hidden files.

[This article](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/git/git-gitignore) explains how to add a `.gitignore` file.

### Storage

Identify the storage location.

1. Is the ARC stored on a mounted external hard drive, network or server?
2. Is the ARC stored in a cloud folder (e.g. Dropbox, iCloud, Sciebo, OneDrive)?

If so, create a new test ARC in the same and another "local-only" location (i.e. non-cloud, non-server) to check whether the issue persists.
If this solves the issue, something may be tricky with your cloud or network connection. Please contact a data steward for help.

### ARC intactness

Identify whether the ARC is intact with all expected files being present.

1. Was the ARC only partially moved or copied from one location to another (i.e. without the hidden `.git` folder)? 
2. Was the ARC downloaded from the DataHUB without LFS objects and tried to upload to another remote?

If so, make sure to move or copy the complete ARC folder and make sure to download the ARC including all LFS objects (not recommended for large ARCs).

{/* 
## Background

Some reasons, why we now sometimes run into git issues

- Over the past years we asked users (e.g. during trainings) to install git with minium required guidance
- Even though more advanced tools ([ARCitect](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/arcitect/)) now bring their own git installation, there might still occur interferences with older installations
- There might also be issues of tools (e.g. [ARCitect](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/arcitect/) and [ARC commander](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/arc-commander/)) or different versions of those tools handling git-related tasks a bit differently or more / less strict (e.g. things like `main` as the default branch)
- The current (versions of) tools were not really built for collaboration with many people on one ARC (at least not with default settings from DataHUB side). So common errors are related to merge conflicts (multiple users changing files) and divergent branches (e.g. between local and remote clones of the ARC).
- Some behaviors are simply very use-case or setup specific and will in any case and even with the best tooling require some stewardship
*/}

## Debugging

1. (if required) [Install Git](https://git-scm.com) on user machine

    :::tip
    check installation via `git --version` in a fresh command line / terminal / powershell window
    :::

2. navigate to the ARC in trouble (via one of many options below)

- On macOS: you can drag&drop the ARC folder from Finder into a terminal
- On macOS: right-click ARC folder-->"Services"--> "New Terminal at Folder"
- On windows: open folder via Explorer; type "cmd" or "powershell" into the address field on top of Explorer
- On linux / macOS terminal: `cd path/to/ARC`
- From inside ARCitect: Tools -> Command Window

3. try some of the git commands and debugging below

:::tip
This is not an exhaustive trouble-shooting list. In most cases git and search machines are your friends. Most Git error messages (displayed in the command line or inside ARCitect) include helpful commands to solve the problem or can easily be searched for in the internet.
:::

## Error messages

This is a list of common error messages, if there is an error with the setup or ARC synchronization. 
The errors are displayed during synchronization via ARCitect (pop-up windows in the menus **Commit** or **DataHUB sync**) or during ARC Commander's `arc sync`.

error message* | possible reason | possible solution
--- | --- | ---
`remote: HTTP Basic: Access denied`  `fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://git.nfdi4plants.org/UserName/ARCname'` | Your computer is not "linked" to your DataHUB account | [Access Denied](#access-denied)
`error: failed to push some refs to 'https://git.nfdi4plants.org/UserName/ARCname' hint: Your push was rejected due to missing or corrupt local objects.` | You tried to upload LFS-tracked files that are not present on your computer | [Missing LFS Objects](#missing-lfs-objects)
`remote: GitLab: LFS objects are missing. Ensure LFS is properly set up or try a manual "git lfs push --all"` | You tried to upload LFS-tracked files that are not present on your computer | [Missing LFS Objects](#missing-lfs-objects)
`LFS: PUT "<https://git.nfdi4plants.org/.../...>" read tcp ... i/o timeout` | You ran into a time out, likely due to very large single files | [Prevent LFS time out error](#prevent-lfs-time-out-error)
`error: failed to push some refs to 'https://git.nfdi4plants.org/UserName/ARCname' hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not have locally.` | Your local ARC is out of sync with the remote. | [ARC not in sync with the DataHUB](#arc-not-in-sync-with-the-datahub)
`ERROR: Can not sync with remote as no remote repository address was specified.` | There is no URL specified for your ARC's remote | [Git remote](#git-remote)
`ERROR: GIT: fatal: repository 'https://git.nfdi4plants.org/UserName/ARCname.git' not found` | The remote URL does not exist | [Git remote](#git-remote)
`ERROR: GIT: fatal: detected dubious ownership` | This is an error typically seen when working on mounted network drives | [Dubious ownership](#dubious-ownership)
`fatal: credential-cache unavailable; no unix socket support` | Likely happens on Windows, if a gitconfig contains `credential.helper=cache` | Adjust the [Git Credential helper](#git-credential-helper) setting
`fatal: Need to specify how to reconcile divergent branches.` | Your ARC contains multiple branches that progressed independently and need to be merged | Contact a data steward.
`error: unable to create file <path/to/file> : Filename too long` | Likely occurs on Windows, if your ARC or files in your ARC are stored in a deeply nested folder, i.e. a folder in a folder in a folder ...| [Allow very long file names](#allow-very-long-file-names)
`UNC paths are not supported. Defaulting to Windows directory.` |  Might be due to working on a network drive or server. | *tbd* Please contact a data steward for support. 

:::tip
Even if ARCitect shows "Complete", it's sometimes worth it to scroll up and see these errors.
:::

## Your two favorite Git commands: status and log

### git status

To get a good summary of the ARC including

- the branch you are on
- files that were committed since last commit
- files that were modified, but not committed (tracked)
- typically anything buggy

```bash
git status
```

If everything's clear and committed, this should prompt something like
> Your branch is up to date with ...
> nothing to commit, working tree clean

### git log

Now, to compare the status of the local clone vs. that of the remote (i.e. the DataHUB) with a bit more confidence and wording, use

```bash
git log
```

This displays the commit history (messages) of the ARC reverse-chronologically, i.e. top-most = latest.
So if the top commit message of the local ARC is different from the last commit message displayed in the DataHUB, the ARC is out of sync.

If you like it prettier, remember "a dog"...

```bash
git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph
```

Hit <kbd>q</kbd> to close the log.

## Git configuration

The gitconfig is basically the settings and preferences for your git installation. There are three types of gitconfigs. Depending on the tool (ARCitect, ARC Commander) and operating system (macOS, Linux, Windows), different git settings may be received from different config files.

flag | meaning
------- | -------
--global | current user on that computer
--system | system-wide (all users)
--local | current repository (ARC)

### Checking the git config

The following command lists all configurations and where they originate (--show-origin) from and what there scope is (--show-scope).

```bash
git config --list --show-origin --show-scope
```

:::tip
The output will be different depending on wether you are "inside" or "outside" an ARC folder (git repository).
:::

In order to only show e.g. the global gitconfig use

```bash
git config --global --list
```

### Recommended git configurations

When executed inside an ARC folder, the `git config --list` should contain the following configurations 

configuration             | explanation                                               
--------------            | ---
`user.name`               | Should display the user's DataHUB account name
`user.email`              | Should display the user's DataHUB account email address
`credential.helper`       | Whether and how DataHUB credentials are stored. Should be `credential.helper=store` (Windows, Linux) or `credential.helper=osxkeychain` (macOS)
`core.longpaths=true`     | Allows to have very long file names or nested folder structures.
`init.defaultbranch=main` | Provides that newly created ARCs work on a `main` branch
`filter.lfs.process=git-lfs filter-process`, `filter.lfs.required=true`, `filter.lfs.clean=git-lfs clean -- %f`, `filter.lfs.smudge=git-lfs smudge -- %f`             | These four settings are required for LFS
`lfs.activitytimeout=0`   | Circumvents a time our error, when trying to push ARCs to the DataHUB with very large files.

### Changing git config

Editing the respective gitconfig is ideally done via command line.

#### Adapt user name and email

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "Your eMail"
```

#### Set main as default branch

```bash
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

#### Git Credential Helper

The gitconfig contains a setting, whether and how to save git credentials on your machine called `credential.helper`.

On Windows, you might run into the error `fatal: credential-cache unavailable; no unix socket support`, if it is set to `credential.helper=cache`. 

This can be solved by either of the following:

1. Remove "credential.helper=cache" via `git config --global --unset credential.helper`.
2. Overwrite the setting with "store" instead of "cache" via `git config --global credential.helper store`.

:::tip
If you use ARC commander, we recommend to use the second approach to keep storing your credentials for DataHUB synchronization. 
:::

#### Allow very long file names

Users (especially on windows) run into errors with long overall file names (i.e. full path). This setting should fix it:

```bash
git config --global core.longpaths true
```

## Git remote

For ARCs the "remote" is the DataHUB. The remote address (ARC url) is stored in the git of the local ARC.
Display the URL, to which the local ARC is connected via

```bash
git remote -v
```

### Adding a remote during `arc sync`

A default remote is usually added by ARC Commander or ARCitect.
If the ARC does not yet exist in the DataHUB, and you created it via ARC Commander and synced it via `arc sync`, you will see this error:

```bash error
ERROR: GIT: fatal: repository 'https://git.nfdi4plants.org/UserName/ARCname.git/' not found 
GIT: warning: redirecting to https://git.nfdi4plants.org/UserName/ARCname.git/
...
GIT: remote: The private project UserName/ARCname was successfully created.  
```

This is not to worry about, the ARC was created in the DataHUB during this process.

If you only see the error `ERROR: GIT: fatal: repository 'https://git.nfdi4plants.org/UserName/ARCname.git/' not found`, but not the following lines mentioning that the ARC was created automatically, make sure to use the "force", i.e. `arc sync --force ...`. 

### Adding a remote via git

If above command does not display any remote, you can add one via

```bash
git remote add origin https://git.nfdi4plants.org/<UserName>/<ARCName>
```

### Editing a remote

You can edit a remote via

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://git.nfdi4plants.org/<UserName>/<ARCName>
```

## Branches

As of now, the DataPLANT tools focus on working on a single branch (`main`).
It can still happen that your ARC has multiple branches e.g. by accident (see `git config` --> `init.defaultbranch`) or because some git-affine collaborator knows how to create them.
To display the branches of the local ARC, use

```bash
git branch
```

:::tip
the current branch is marked with an asterisk (*) to the left
:::

If you also want to display branches that exist on the remote (but not locally), use

```bash
git branch --all
```

## Git LFS

[Git LFS](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/git/git-lfs) is basically the system in the back to simplify working with git and (ARCs containing) large data files. ARC commander and ARCitect offer options to download (clone) an ARC without large files; speeding up the process and avoiding waste of data storage, if you are only interested e.g. in the metadata.

In order to properly upload large(r) files to the DataHUB via "pure git" (i.e. on the command line) or via **ARC Commander** or **ARCitect**, Git-LFS needs to be initiated on every computer (and user account) before using these tools.

### Initiating git-lfs

#### Checking whether LFS (large file storage) works properly for your ARCs

- In ARCitect, you can see large files (defined by the threshold in the commit menu) flagged as `LFS` in the file tree
- In the DataHUB LFS files are also flagged as `LFS`. In addition, you can click in the right sidebar of your ARC in the DataHUB on "Project Storage". Here, the major amount of your data should be stored in "LFS", while only a minor part is stored in "Repository". 

#### Via command line

- If you have git-lfs installed and know how to use there command line, simply run `git lfs install`.
- You can check for the proper configuration via `git config --list --show-origin --show-scope`. Amongst others, the config should contain the following lines

```
filter.lfs.process=git-lfs filter-process
filter.lfs.required=true
filter.lfs.clean=git-lfs clean -- %f
filter.lfs.smudge=git-lfs smudge -- %f
```

#### Manually

In your home folder (Windows: `C:/Users/<UserName>`, macOS: `Users/<UserName>`), create or edit the file called .gitconfig to include the following lines. 

```
[filter "lfs"]
	process = git-lfs filter-process
	required = true
	clean = git-lfs clean -- %f
	smudge = git-lfs smudge -- %f
```

### Prevent LFS Time out error

When users try to upload very large files, i.e. not the overall push size, but single-very-large-files, they might run into a time out error. This setting should fix it:

```bash
git config --global lfs.activitytimeout 0
```

### Missing LFS objects

The following errors are related to missing LFS object: 

```bash
hint: Your push was rejected due to missing or corrupt local objects.
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://git.nfdi4plants.org/UserName/ARCName.git'
```

```bash
remote: GitLab: LFS objects are missing. Ensure LFS is properly set up or try a manual "git lfs push --all".
```

Possible reasons, why this happens:

- you have downloaded (cloned) an ARC without the large files (i.e. only the pointer files) and try to upload it to another location on the DataHUB (i.e. new remote due to a transfer to other user, group, etc. or renamed ARC)
- you moved a pointer file (instead of an actual large file) from one ARC on your computer to another ARC and tried to upload

In this case you would have to download all LFS objects from the original remote first -> ask a data steward for help.

### Step-by-step track large file(s) via Git-LFS

Done in small steps plus logging.
Note this works on shells like macOS terminal, linux terminal, Git Bash (available for Windows).
This likely does not work on Windows Powershell and definitely not in Windows command prompt.

<Steps>

1. Track files via LFS (this adds them to .gitattributes)

    ```bash
    git lfs track "assays/RNAseq_RawData/dataset/**"
    ```

    :::note
    This lists the respective files in your ARC's `.gitattributes` file.
    :::

2. git track the `.gitattributes` file first

    ```bash
    git add .gitattributes
    ```

3. Git add the large files

    ```bash
    git add assays/RNAseq_RawData/dataset/*
    ```

4. Git commit (and write what's happening to a log file)

    ```bash
    GIT_CURL_VERBOSE=1 GIT_TRACE=1 GIT_TRACE_PACKET=1 git commit -m "add rnaseq files to LFS" -v >> git-commit-LFS.log 2>&1 &
    ```

5. Git push (and write what's happening to a log file)

    ```bash
    GIT_CURL_VERBOSE=1 GIT_TRACE=1 GIT_TRACE_PACKET=1 git push -v >> git-push-LFS.log 2>&1 &
    ```

</Steps>

### Git-LFS track files according to file size

To track all files in the ARC which are above a certain size (e.g. 10 MB), you can run the following loop in bash

```bash
find . -path './.git' -prune -o -type f -size +10M -print | while read -r file; do
    git lfs track "$file"
done
```

:::note
This lists the respective files in your ARC's `.gitattributes` file.
Check or edit the `.gitattributes` file and then `git add` and `git commit` it to take effect.
:::


### Check the status of LFS-tracked files

```bash
git lfs status
```

### List LFS-tracked files

To get a list of LFS-tracked files including the size of the original file, run

```bash
git lfs ls-files -ls
```

This will display the object ID (oid), the relative path to the file and the object size.
The oid is also stored in the pointer file at the file's position.

:::tip
If checked-out and downloaded, a file with an oid `77080c4dc5820ede3e992e8116772ae6ec6ba6096e05df4e49fbb5f0665544b2` would be in the folder `.git/lfs/objects/77/08/`. So the first 4 characters of the OiD are split into two subfolders of `.git/lfs/objects/` (i.e. `/77/08/`).
:::

### Debug LFS-tracked files

To get a report of all LFS-tracked files including there status, use

```bash
git lfs ls-files -d
```

Amongst others, this report will print for every LFS file, whether it is downloaded (`checkout: true; download: true`) to the local ARC or not (`checkout: false; download: false`).


## Common issues and error messages

### ARC files opened in multiple programs

A common source for issues are multiple programs that work on the ARC in parallel.

- In particular, working on the ARC with multiple softwares that have Git integration may lead to confusion. For instance, while you sync the ARC using ARCitect or ARC Commander, the changes may still be displayed as un-committed in VSCode, RStudio, PyCharm or other third-party software.

- Many softwares produce hidden temporary files. By default these files are not shown or synced by the ARCitect or ARC Commander. They might still sometimes lead to confusion, e.g. not being able to commit changes. This is especially the case for office software (Excel, Word, LibreOffice, etc.), where e.g. one of the ISA files (`isa.investigation.xlsx`, `isa.study.xlsx`, `isa.assay.xlsx`) or another office file stored in the ARC may be open. However, also ARCs opened in Windows Explorer or macOS Finder sometimes led to issues.

- Before syncing an ARC, close all ARC-files and Explorer / Finder windows
- Avoid to edit, delete, or move files, while the ARC is being synced to the DataHUB

### ARC not in sync with the DataHUB

Your local ARC is likely out of sync with the remote. This happens, if you or an invited colleague work(s) on the same ARC from a different location (e.g. the DataHUB or another computer). Before working on your ARC, make sure to update the local clone via one of these

- ARCitect --> Versioning --> Pull
- `arc sync`
- `git pull` (-> this would also prompt a message if changes need to be merged)

### Access denied

Sometimes you run into permission issues such as

```bash error
remote: HTTP Basic: Access denied. The provided password or token is incorrect or your account has 2FA enabled and you must use a personal access token instead of a password.
```

```bash error
fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://git.nfdi4plants.org/UserName/ARCName.git/'
```

This is due to missing or outdated DataHUB credentials on your computer.
It usually helps to just retrieve new ones. If not, you might have to remove existing credentials stored on your computer.

#### Authenticate the computer

Option 1: [via ARC Commander](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/arc-commander/setup/access)

Option 2: "by hand"
  1. Login to the [DataHUB](https://git.nfdi4plants.org/)
  2. Create a new [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://git.nfdi4plants.org/-/profile/personal_access_tokens) with scope `api`
  3. Run a git command (e.g. `arc sync`, `git pull`) to trigger being asked for git credentials
     1. Provide your DataHUB username
     2. Use the token instead of your password

#### Delete stored credentials

If (new) authentication alone does not help, you might need to delete existing tokens or passwords first.

1. Run `git config --get-regexp "credential"` to find out whether and where credentials are stored
2. This typically displays one of the following
   > credential.helper store

   > credential.helper osxkeychain (only on macOS)

3. If `credential.helper store` is displayed, the credentials are typically stored in `~/.git-credentials`, a hidden text file stored in the user's home folder. Edit this file and delete the row(s) containing "git.nfdi4plants.org" (`https://<UserName>:<Token>@git.nfdi4plants.org`).

4. On macOS (if `credential.helper osxkeychain` is displayed) open the app "Keychain Access", search and delete passwords for "git.nfdi4plants.org".

### Dubious ownership

The error `ERROR: GIT: fatal: detected dubious ownership` typically occurs when working on a mounted network drive (Fileshare, File Server, NAS). Very simplified: the user on the computer and the owner of the network drive differ and git tries to safe you from working in a folder you do not own.

You can add the path to the ARC to the list of safe directories via the command

```bash
git config --global --add safe.directory %(prefix)///servername/share/path/to/ARC/
```

You can circumvent this error by adding **all directories** to your list of safe directories via the command

```bash
git config --global --add safe.directory *
```

:::caution
This might however pose a safety risk. Please read the details here: https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-safedirectory
:::

### Get more log

To help troubleshooting add (some or all) variables `GIT_CURL_VERBOSE=1 GIT_TRACE=1 GIT_TRACE_PACKET=1` before your git command to get more info, e.g.

```bash
GIT_CURL_VERBOSE=1 GIT_TRACE=1 GIT_TRACE_PACKET=1 git push -v >> git-push-LFS.log 2>&1 &
```
