[elab2ARC](http://nfdi4plants.org/elab2arc) is a tool for converting [eLabFTW](https://www.elabftw.net/) experiments into [Annotated Research Context (ARC)](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/core-concepts/arc/) format. It allows researchers to easily fetch experiment data from eLabFTW instances and update or push these files to DataHUB in ARC format. The application streamlines the management of data from lab experiments to repositories, improving efficiency in scientific data handling.

## Why is elab2ARC needed?

Many researchers rely on [electronic lab notebooks (ELNs)](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/fundamentals/electronic-lab-notebooks/) to document their experiments due to their flexibility in handling free-form text and supporting data files up to 100 MB. However, when metadata standardization becomes necessary or when raw data files exceed the file size limit, other research data standards, such as Annotated Research Context (ARC), may be required.

ARC offers robust metadata annotation tools and customizable templates that help standardize the unstructured content typically found in ELNs. Additionally, ARC supports large files up to 10 GB, making it an excellent complement to ELNs like eLabFTW, which are not designed to handle raw data storage or larger file sizes.

Manually transferring metadata from ELNs to ARC can be both error-prone and time-consuming. To address this challenge, elab2ARC provides an efficient solution by automating the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of data from ELN records into ARC-compliant structures. This tool streamlines the process, reduces errors, and ensures consistency, enhancing research data management workflows.

## Features of elab2ARC

**elab2ARC** simplifies converting eLabFTW experiment data into Annotated Research Context (ARC) format. Key features include:

- **Direct Data Retrieval**: Extracts experiment data from eLabFTW using experiment IDs and API keys.
- **ARC Conversion**: Transforms data into ARC format, organizing protocols, datasets, and metadata.
- **DataHub Integration**: Automates ARC file updates and pushes them to a DataHub repository.
- **Multi-Instance Support**: Manages data from multiple eLabFTW instances seamlessly.

These features streamline workflows, ensuring efficient and standardized data management.

## Setting up Tokens for elab2ARC


### Create an Personal Access Token in DataHUB

import DataHubPat from '../datahub/navigation-settings/datahub-generate-pat.mdx'

<DataHubPat />

### Create an eLabFTW API key

<Steps>
1. Login to your eLabFTW instance 
2. Navigate to `User Settings`

- Click **Submission** [3] to fetch entries. 
- **Check Status** [4] provides detailed information about the submission. 
- **Preview** [5] opens the `eLabFTW tab` and shows more information about the eLabFTW entry. Here you can also select linked Experiments/Resources for conversion. 



### Preview eLabFTW entry
In the `eLabFTW tab`, you get detailed information about your eLabFTW entry.
- Main text of the entry [1]
- administrative Metadata [2]
- linked Resources and Experiments [3]
- and Attachments [4]

With the checkboxes, you can select entries for conversion. 


### Select ARC & Start Conversion


- In the `ARCs tab`, select the ARC into which the elabFTW entry should be converted. 
- You can use an existing ARC by clicking the **Convert to assay** button [1] or create a new ARC with the **Create a new ARC** button [2]. 
- Use **Start Conversion** button [3] to start the elab2ARC conversion.

## Conversion 

![](@images/elab2arc/elab2arc-output.png)

The elab2ARC tool will automatically convert your eLabFTW experiments into ARC format
- create a new assay folder with eLabFTW experiment name as assay name (green)
- create the assay folder structure (dataset/protocols/isa.assay)
- convert experiment main text into a .md file and store it in the protocol folder (purple)
- add all attachments of the eLabFTW experiment into the dataset folder (yellow)
- enter name/email/affiliation of the eLabFTW experiment metadata into the isa.assay sheet
