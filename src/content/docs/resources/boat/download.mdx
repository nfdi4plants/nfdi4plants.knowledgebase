Added enough annotations? Then just click on the download button and decide if the output metadata is converted into a **.xlsx** or **.json** file.

    <ViolaSays>
    After some time I selected enough metadata from the process in my protocol and want to get my metadata file. Using the download button lets
    me select two different file format. Which one do I choose?
    </ViolaSays>

It depends on which file format fits to your workflow or environment the best, for example XLSX works naturally great with MS Excel or the [ARCitect](https://nfdi4plants.github.io/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/arcitect/). The JSON format is more suitable for developing environments but can also be added to the ARC.

## Workflow with demo dataset

  <Steps>
  1. Click at the download icon at the top
  2. Select between "as .xlsx" or "as .json"
      <ViolaSays>
      Since I´m a lab scientist I prefer .xlsx because I already use MS Excel a lot for my scientific work! So my metadata table fits perfect to it.
      But I can also add it to my ARC as an addition to my protocols.
      </ViolaSays>
  3. Your metadata set gets downloaded. As a xlsx file, your table might looks like this:

      <div class="w-full overflow-x-auto">
  
        <div style="overflow-wrap:normal" class="min-w-max [&_th]:max-w-32 [&_td]:max-w-32 [&_code]:[overflow-wrap:normal]" >

          | `Parameter [Light intensity]` | `Unit` | `Term Source REF (MIAPPE:0101)` | `Term Accession Number (MIAPPE:0101)` | `Parameter [Temperature]` | `Unit` | `Term Source REF (NCIT:C25206)` | `Term Accession Number (NCIT:C25206)` | `Parameter [growth time]` | `Unit` | `Term Source REF (DPBO:0000100)` | `Term Accession Number (DPBO:0000100)` |
          |-------------------------------|--------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
          | 200 | einstein per square meter per second based unit | UO | https://bioregistry.io/UO:1000156 | | degree celsius | UO | https://bioregistry.io/UO:0000027 | 4 | day | UO | https://bioregistry.io/UO:0000033 |
       
        </div>
      </div>

  </Steps>
</Card>

And that's it!



If you want to annotate more metadata in a new protocol, you can delete it using the red delete button or just upload a new file which overwrites the current document.
If the protocol inherits multiple processes, you can just delete all your added annotation after you downloaded them.
