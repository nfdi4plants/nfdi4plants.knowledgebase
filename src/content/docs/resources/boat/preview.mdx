To have an overview of your already added annotations, you can always click on the table icon at the top to open a table which has all the annotations with their keys, terms and values. 

In the preview, you can also delete individual annotations in the right column.

Under "Help" in the navigation bar you find a short form of this documentation with pictures and under "Contact" you can write issues on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nfdi4plants/BOAT-Builder-for-Ontology-Annotation-Tables) if you find any bugs or want to suggest ideas for BOAT.
