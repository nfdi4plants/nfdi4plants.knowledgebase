Your new annotation might need some adjustments. First, you probably want to change the **Keytype** to be more descriptive for the header. 
By clicking on the blue box, a dropdown opens which lets you determine the Keytype such as **Characteristics, Factor, Component** or **Parameter**. Under "more" you can find more descriptive Keytypes which are for more general data about the protocol like date, performer, description, type, uri and version.



## Using ontologies

As a next step, you should consider connecting your added key or terms to [ontologies](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/fundamentals/ontologies/). Implementing ontologies enhances the value of your data by using predefined vocabulary with an unique ID.


To do this, just double click inside the text field and the built-in Term Search component will search in the [SwateDB](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/fundamentals/ontology-service-landscape/#swatedb-and-swobup) for fitting ontologies. You might change the word a bit to get the best results. The search suggestions can be expanded to see the definitions and the ID of the ontology.
Clicking on an ontology suggestion replaces the term in the text field and a check mark appears on the right to ensure the use of an ontology.

In the same way, you can add more annotations or complete the metadata in the last created annotation. 

<ViolaSays>
With that I can comfortably search for a fitting ontology for my Key and Term without changing my workspace.
Is my metadata example about my process more FAIR now?
</ViolaSays>

Depends on how detailed you annotate it! Adding ontologies significantly enhances the FAIRness according **findability** and **interoperability** by machines and humans.
But making it also **accessible** and **reusable**, you should implement your metadata in a appropriate environment, for example an ARC.

## Workflow with demo dataset

<Card icon="pen" title="BOAT">
  <Steps>
  1. To change the Keytype, click on the blue field at the left side of the Key textfield.
      <ViolaSays>
      For my already added information, I would choose the Keytype "Parameter".
      </ViolaSays>
  2. Double click in the text field of the Key `Light intensity` inside the annotation note.
  3. Inside the Term Search suggestions, click on the best fitting one. Your ontology use gets validated with a check mark.
  4. Redo this step with the Term `Einstein`. Here the best suggestion might be `einstein per square meter per second based unit`.

      :::note
      The suggestion does not always fit the word you highlighted.
      You can find more info about the Term Search [here](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/swate/term-search/).
      :::
  5. Repeat those steps for the `Temperature` and `Growth time` annotations. `°C` must be changed to `degree celsius`.
  </Steps>
</Card>

Now, your ontologized metadata structure looks like this: 

<div class="grid md:grid-cols-2">

  <div class="md:!m-0">
  
  ##### Parameters [ ]

  - <ParentChild parent="Light intensity" child="200 einstein per square meter per second based unit"/>
  - <ParentChild parent="Temperature" child="[]°C"/>
  - <ParentChild parent="Growth time" child="4day"/>
  
  </div>

</div>


:::tip
All annotations can be edited or deleted any time with the trash bin icon in the upper right corner of each annotation note.
