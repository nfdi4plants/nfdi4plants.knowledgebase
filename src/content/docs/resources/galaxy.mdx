Galaxy is an online platform that allows you to easily analyze data in your ARCs with established bioinformatics tools and pipelines. 

In this guide we introduce how to access ARCs from within Galaxy. To access the data of an ARC, you must first provide a DataHUB access token in Galaxy, which is used to authenticate Galaxy to DataHUB. To create a new token and add it to [Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.eu/), you can proceed as described below.

:::note[DataPLANT login to Galaxy]
You can use your DataPANT account on the Galaxy instances https://usegalaxy.eu/ and https://plants.usegalaxy.eu/.
:::

## Create an access token in DataHUB

import DataHubPat from '../datahub/navigation-settings/datahub-generate-pat.mdx'

<DataHubPat />

:::tip
Only the scopes "api" (for write access) and "read_api" (for read access) are relevant for Galaxy.
:::

:::caution
After you created the token, you can copy and view it. After you leave the site, you will **not** be able to do so again.

## Add the token to Galaxy

<Steps>

1. Visit [usegalaxy.eu](https://usegalaxy.eu/) and log in or create an account. It is possible to log in using your DataPlant account.
2. Open the "User" drop down menu and
3. select "Preferences".
4. In the user preference settings, select "Manage Information".
5. Copy your token into the "API read access token" field. This filed is located at the bottom of the "User preferences" menu. Click "Save" to adopt your changes.

</Steps>

:::tip
Despite the name "API **read** access token", tokens with write access rights (like those with the scope "api") will also work or, respectively, are required.

## Data import

With the token available to Galaxy, you are now able to import data. You can do this as described below.

<Steps>

1. Click on the "Upload Data".
2. Pick "Choose remote files".
3. Scroll down and select "DataPLANT DataHub ARCs".
4. Explore ARCs or search for a specific one.
   
   :::note
   If you receive an `Internal Server Error` during this step, your access token may have expired. Please follow the steps above to renew the access token and add it to your Galaxy Account.
   :::

6. Inside an ARC, choose the file you want to import to Galaxy. Confirm with "Ok".
7. Click start to begin the import process to Galaxy. This may take some time, depending
   on the workload on the Galaxy server and the size of your file.

</Steps>

## Data export

It is also possible to export datasets back to an ARC. You can do this as described below.

<Steps>

1. On the left sidebar, open the menu "Send Data".
2. Select "Export datasets" to remote files source.
3. In the opening menu, select "DataPLANT DataHUB ARCs".
4. Select or
5. search for an ARC.
6. Chose a directory inside an ARC where your dataset should be stored.
7. Choose the dataset you want to export,
8. Clock on "Run Tool" to start the export process. This may take some time, depending
   on the workload on the Galaxy server and the size of your file.
