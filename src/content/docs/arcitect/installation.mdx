:::note
ARCitect depends on <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">Git</a> and <a href="https://git-lfs.com" target="_blank">Git LFS</a>.
The ARCitect installer for Windows includes both tools automatically.
On macOS and Linux, Git and Git LFS have to be installed separately.

<Steps>
1. Head to the ARCitect's GitHub [release page](https://github.com/nfdi4plants/ARCitect/releases/latest).
2. Under "Assets" Download the latest release for Windows (`ARCitect-x.x.x-win.zip`).
3. In Windows Explorer, open the folder where you downloaded the ARCitect.
4. Unzip (`Right click` ➞ `Extract All..`) the folder (`ARCitect-x.x.x-win.zip`). You can move this folder to another location (e.g. `Program files`).
5. Start the ARCitect, by clicking the `ARCitect` application.

6. Once started, you see a Windows Defender warning. To proceed, click `More info` and then `Run anyway`.

7. Windows Defender Firewall further asks you to allow network communication. This enables communication with the [DataHUB](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/datahub).

### Accept incoming network connections

Every time you start the ARCitect, you are asked to accept incoming network connections.

### ARCitect Installation

:::note[Installation now based on DEB package]
To avoid issues on certain Linux distributions, ARCitect installation is based on DEB package (instead of AppImage) since version 0.0.59. 
:::

<Steps>

1. Install additional dependencies via
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-0 libnotify4 xdg-utils libsecret-1-0
    ```

    :::note
    On some linux distributions you have to run `sudo apt --fix-broken install` afterwards.
    :::

2. Head to the ARCitect's GitHub <a href="https://github.com/nfdi4plants/ARCitect/releases/latest" target="_blank">release page</a>.
3. Download the Linux DEB package `ARCitect-x.x.x_amd64.deb`.
4. Install ARCitect

    ```bash
    sudo dpkg -i ./ARCitect-x.x.x_amd64.deb
    ```

5. Start the ARCitect via

    ```bash
    arcitect
    ```

    :::note[Admin privileges]
    `apt-get install` and `dpkg -i` often require admin privileges, since they write into system directories. You can circumvent this problem by local installations in folders where you have permission, e.g.

        ```
        dpkg-deb -x ./ARCitect-x.x.x_amd64.deb $HOME/arc
        ```

        would install the ARCitect in a folder in your home directory. You can then add it to your path via

        ```
        export PATH="$HOME/arc/ARCitect:$PATH"
        ```

        To install `git`, `git-lfs`, `libgtk-3-0`, `libnotify4`, `xdg-utils` and `libsecret-1-0`, if they are not already installed, you can use `apt download`, which gives you the `.deb` files for their installations.  
        From there you can proceed the same as written above for the ARCitect. `apt download` does not resolve package dependencies, so you may have to resolve them manually.
