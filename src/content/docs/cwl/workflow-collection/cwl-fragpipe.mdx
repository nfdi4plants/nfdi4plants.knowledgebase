# FragPipe

[FragPipe](https://fragpipe.nesvilab.org/) is a software suite for the analysis of mass spectrometry-based proteomics data. It integrates multiple state-of-the-art software tools and algorithms into a unified, 
user-friendly graphical interface, allowing researchers to process raw MS data efficiently.

# Setting up the FragPipe ARC-CWL workflow

The FragPipe ARC-CWL workflow requires several files and directories to be set up correctly. The following sections will guide you through the setup process.

## ARC

You need an ARC to run this workflow, since necessary information about the experiment is retrieved from the assay and study files by the workflow. 
How to set up an ARC is described in this [Getting Started Guide](https://nfdi4plants.github.io/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/start-here/).

Special requirements for the ARC:

- Assay and study files containing columns describing the data:
  - Experiment (e.g., hot/cold)
  - Replicate (e.g., 1, 2, 3, ...)
  - Acquisition mode (DDA or DIA)
- One assay sheet named "MassSpectrometry," which is linked to previous assays and studies containing the aforementioned columns through inputs and outputs (standard assay/study setup, this is described in the Getting Started Guide):
  - The output of this sheet must be of type `Data` and contain the names of your mass spectrometry files or folders (just the name, not the path, e.g., `MyRun.d`).
- One folder in the `workflows` directory named "Fragpipe."

## Dockerfile

The current official Docker image is missing `curl`. This can be circumvented by using your own Dockerfile based on the official one and adding the `curl` installation command to the file.

- Download the Dockerfile [here](https://github.com/caroott/FragPipe-CWL/blob/master/Dockerfile) by clicking on the download button in the upper right corner.

- Place the Dockerfile in the `Fragpipe` folder within the `workflows` directory.

## ARC Parameter Collection Script

This workflow uses a script to collect the required parameters for the FragPipe ARC-CWL workflow. 

- Download the script [here](https://github.com/caroott/FragPipe-CWL/blob/master/scripts/manifestAndWorkflow.fsx).
- Place the script in the `scripts` folder within the `Fragpipe` directory in the `workflows` directory.

This script will create the required manifest file and adapt the workflow file for the run.

## CommandLineTool and Workflow Descriptions

- Download the [FragPipe CommandLineTool](https://github.com/caroott/FragPipe-CWL/blob/master/Fragpipe.cwl).
- Download the [ManifestAndWorkflow CommandLineTool](https://github.com/caroott/FragPipe-CWL/blob/master/ManifestAndWorkflow.cwl).
- Download the [Workflow](https://github.com/caroott/FragPipe-CWL/blob/master/workflow.cwl).
- Place all three files in the `Fragpipe` directory within the `workflows` directory.

The workflow executes both CommandLineTool descriptions in the correct order.

## FragPipe Tools

The FragPipe tools must be downloaded manually due to licensing restrictions. The easiest way is to download all required tools through the 
FragPipe GUI and mount them into the Docker container. For this, the tools must be placed in the `tools` directory within the workflow directory.

### Downloading the Tools with the FragPipe GUI

- Download the FragPipe GUI from the [FragPipe releases](https://github.com/Nesvilab/FragPipe/releases) and unzip it.
- Navigate to the `bin` folder and run the `fragpipe.exe`.
- In the Config tab, click on the `Download / Update` button and follow the steps.

- Copy the `tools` directory into your workflow directory.

## Directory structure

After obtaining all required files, your workflows directory structure should look like this:

    <FileTree>
    - **workflows**
      - **Fragpipe**
        - Dockerfile
        - Fragpipe.cwl
        - ManifestAndWorkflow.cwl
        - Workflow.cwl
        - **tools**
        - **scripts**
          - manifestAndWorkflow.fsx
    </FileTree>

# Setting up the run

The run requires a `run.cwl` and a `run.yml` file. The `run.cwl` file content could look like this:
```yaml
cwlVersion: v1.2
class: Workflow

requirements:
  - class: MultipleInputFeatureRequirement
  - class: SubworkflowFeatureRequirement
# you can specify resources here:
#  - class: ResourceRequirement
#    coresMin: 20
#    ramMin: 40960
inputs:
  arcDirectory: Directory
  runName: string
  assayName: string
  experimentColumn: string
  replicateColumn: string
  acquisitionColumn: string
  fastAPath: string
  ddaOnly: string
  headless: boolean
  workdir: string
  toolsFolder: string
  threads: int

steps:
  FragpipeAll:
    run: ../../workflows/Fragpipe/workflow.cwl
    in:
      arcDirectory: arcDirectory
      runName: runName
      assayName: assayName
      experimentColumn: experimentColumn
      replicateColumn: replicateColumn
      acquisitionColumn: acquisitionColumn
      fastAPath: fastAPath
      ddaOnly: ddaOnly
      headless: headless
      workdir: workdir
      toolsFolder: toolsFolder
      threads: threads
    out: [result]

outputs:
  FragpipeAllResult:
    type: Directory
    outputSource: FragpipeAll/result

# The following is metadata for the workflow

arc:author:
  - class: arc:Person
    arc:first name: "Caroline"
    arc:last name: "Ott"
    arc:email: "caroline.ott@rptu.de"
    arc:affiliation: "RPTU Kaiserslautern/Landau"

```

The `run.yml` file contains all the necessary information for your run. The `run.yml` file content could look like this:

An example `run.yml` file could look like this:
```yaml
arcDirectory:
  class: Directory
  path: ../../
runName: MyRun
assayName: MyAssay
experimentColumn: "Condition, Parameter"
replicateColumn: "Replicate, Characteristic"
acquisitionColumn: "scan mode, Parameter"
fastAPath: ./arc/studies/MyOrganism/resources/ProteinsFastaWithDecoys.fasta
ddaOnly: "TRUE"
headless: true
workdir: ./arc/runs/MyRun
toolsFolder: ./arc/workflows/Fragpipe/tools
threads: 20

# The following is metadata for the workflow

arc:performer:
  - class: arc:Person
    arc:first name: "Your"
    arc:last name: "Name"
    arc:email: "your@email"
    arc:affiliation: "Your institution"
```

- Copy the content for the `run.cwl` and `run.yml` blocks into a text editor (e.g., Notepad).
- Save them as `run.cwl` and `run.yml` in the `MyRun` (example name) folder within the `runs` directory.
- Update the paths and names in the `run.yml` file to match your ARC:
  - `arcDirectory` doesn't change.
  - Paths always start with `./arc`, since the ARC is mounted into the Docker container with that name.
  - The `runName` is the name you want to give your run.
    - The `workdir` name is usually the same as the `runName`.
  - The `assayName` is the name of the assay you want to analyze.
- Update the `experimentColumn`, `replicateColumn`, and `acquisitionColumn` values to match your assay or study files:
  - The first part is the column name, the second part is the column type (Characteristic, Parameter or Factor).
  - These three columns must exist in your assay or study files.
  - These columns are the ones you specified [here](#arc).
- `ddaOnly` can be set to "TRUE" or "FALSE":
  - If you are analyzing DIA files, set it to "FALSE".
- The number of threads can be set to the number of files you want to analyze in parallel:
  - You also need to specify the number of threads in the `run.cwl` file under `ResourceRequirement`.
    - Remove the `#` in front of the lines and set the number of cores and RAM you want to use.

## FragPipe Workflow

FragPipe requires a `fragpipe.workflow` file specifying the workflow settings. You can use a predesigned workflow from the [FragPipe repository](https://github.com/Nesvilab/FragPipe/tree/develop/MSFragger-GUI/workflows) 
or create your own (this is easier with the GUI).

### Using the GUI

- Open the FragPipe GUI and navigate to the `Workflow` tab.
- Select a workflow and press the `Load workflow` button.
  ![](@images/guides/cwl/Select_workflow.png)
- Follow the instructions on the [FragPipe website](https://fragpipe.nesvilab.org/) for your use case, or keep the preset workflow you selected.
- Click on the `Save to custom folder` button in the `Workflow` tab and save it to the `runs` directory in the folder named `MyRun` (example name) under the name `fragpipe.workflow`.

## Directory structure

After you obtained those files, the folder structure should look like this:

    <FileTree>
    - **runs**
      - **MyRun**
        - run.cwl
        - run.yml
        - fragpipe.workflow
    - **workflows**
      - **Fragpipe**
        - Dockerfile
        - Fragpipe.cwl
        - ManifestAndWorkflow.cwl
        - Workflow.cwl
        - **tools**
        - **scripts**
          - manifestAndWorkflow.fsx
    </FileTree>

# Running the Workflow

A CWL runner is required to run the workflow.

- Install the CWL reference runner as described here: [CWL Runner Installation](https://nfdi4plants.github.io/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/cwl/cwl-runner-installation/).
- Open the command-line tool.
- Activate the environment in which you installed the CWL runner:
  - Instructions for this can be found [here](https://nfdi4plants.github.io/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/cwl/cwl-runner-installation/#cwltool-usage).
- Navigate to the `runs` folder:
  - Use the `cd` command to navigate there:
    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/runs
    ```
- Run the workflow with the following command:
    ```bash
    cwltool ./MyRun/run.cwl ./MyRun/run.yml
    ```
