Licenses are essential for defining how others can use, modify, and distribute the code or data within a project. When you create and share an ARC, a license provides the formal framework that protects the data creators’ rights while clarifying the terms of use for the content.

## Add a license directly via the DataHUB

In the DataHUB, a license is essentially a standardized text file. 
To add a `LICENSE` to your ARC

<Steps>

1. Navigate to your ARC in the DataHUB,
2. Click on "Add LICENSE" on the right sidebar menu(1),
3. Use a provided license template or enter the license text.

:::tip
We recommend to use a [CC-BY 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode.txt), which you can add by selecting the template `Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International`

:::note
Remember to sync your local ARC (via ARCitect or ARC Commander) after creating a `LICENSE` file in the DataHUB.
