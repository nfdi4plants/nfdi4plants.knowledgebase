**DataHUB Groups**

- A "Group" is a group of users (then "members" of that group) with specific [permissions](/datahub/datahub-working-together#roles-and-permissions).
- A group (e.g. your lab or consortium) can share ARCs.
- Groups help you communicate with all group members and manage permissions for the ARCs shared in that group.
- Depending on their assigned roles, members of the group can view, edit, delete, and / or maintain the ARCs of that group.
- If someone has access to a group, they get access to all the ARC in the group.
- The group Owner(s) can adjust group settings and manage group memberships.
- Groups can have subgroups (with a subset of members). Subgroups have the same features as groups.


## Groups panel

The groups panel lists all user groups.

:::tip
When syncing an ARC shared with a group, the group's url rather than your user url is used to generate the ARC's address.
:::

:::tip
Within ARCitect, you can directly choose your group namespace to sync your ARC with the group.
