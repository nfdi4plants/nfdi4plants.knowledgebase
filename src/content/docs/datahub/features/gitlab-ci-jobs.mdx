This guide demonstrates how to extend DataHUB's AutoDevOps pipeline with own [CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/ "Continuous Integration (CI) / Continuous Deployment (CD)") jobs.

:::note[Advanced Users]
This guide needs some familiarity with GitLab.
:::

:::caution[Experimental]
Since some tools exemplified below are under development, consider this experimental.
1. Be aware that the examples maybe outdated.
2. Run on a test ARC first and check for expected results.
3. Please let us know, if something is not working as expected.
:::

## Use-case

Every time an ARC in the DataHUB is updated, an "AutoDevOps Pipeline" automatically runs certain jobs on the ARC. This is employed for instance to create machine-readable metadata (`arc.json`) as artifacts, or – if triggered – to [validate the ARC](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/arc-validation/cqc-pipelines) against different validation packages (e.g. for publication via the DataPLANT publication service).

Some advanced users want to extend this pipeline with other jobs to run on the ARC as it facilitates to 
- run CLI tools that are still under development (and have not yet be implemented in the global AutoDevOps Pipeline) on ARCs
- as a data steward support users with the features of these CLI tools without the need for local tool installation and execution


## Adding custom CI/CD jobs

<Steps>
1. In the DataHUB, open the ARC for which you would like to add a custom CI/CD pipeline
2. Create a new `.gitlab-ci.yml` file at the root of the ARC by either
   - navigating via the sidebar to `Build` -> `Pipeline editor` or
   - adding it as a new file to the ARC via DataHUB
3. Use or adapt one of the examples below for your ARC's `.gitlab-ci.yml`
</Steps>

   :::tip
   You can also import `.gitlab-ci.yml` to the root's ARC via ARCitect or add it manually.
   :::

## Generic example

This example extends the stages of the "Auto-DevOps" pipeline with a job called `my_own_ci_job`. 
The `my_own_ci_job` only executes the simple `echo` command and prints "doing things..."

import GenericCI from 'assets/gitlab-ci-generic.yml?url&raw'

<Code 
  title=".gitlab-ci.yml"
  code={ GenericCI } 
  lang="yaml"
  mark={[10, 12, 13, 14, 15]}
/>

## Example: ARC Mermaid Graph

This example extends the "Auto-DevOps" pipeline with the [arcIsaProcessMermaid](https://github.com/nfdi4plants/arcIsaProcessMermaid) tool. This dotnet tool tries to draw a graphical overview of the ISA information in the ARC and stores it in an artifact file `arc-mermaid.md`. Once run, the `arc-mermaid.md` file can be downloaded from the job artifacts in the DataHUB.

import ARCMermaid from 'assets/gitlab-ci-arc-mermaid.yml?url&raw'

<Code 
  title=".gitlab-ci.yml"
  code={ ARCMermaid } 
  lang="yaml"
  mark={[17, 19]}
/>

## Downloading artifacts

After the pipeline has run successfully, you can download the generated artifact (e.g. `arc-mermaid.md`) from the DataHUB

<Steps>
  1. In the DataHUB, navigate to the ARC's sidebar to `Build` -> `Artifacts` (1)
  2. Search for the job of interest (e.g. `arcIsaProcessMermaid`) in the list of artifacts and click the download icon (2)
</Steps>
