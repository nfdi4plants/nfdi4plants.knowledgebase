This guide shows you how to generate a Project Access Token. Project Access Token are similar to [Personal Access Token](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/datahub/navigation-settings/datahub-generate-pat), but Project Access Tokens are scoped to a project, so you cannot use them to access resources from other projects. 

<Steps>

1. Sign in to the [DataHUB](https://git.nfdi4plants.org/)
2. Open your Project (ARC)
3. Navigate to 'Settings' (1), then 'Access Tokens' (2): ![Alt text](@images/arc-commander/arc-commander-access-2.png)
3. Choose a name for your token (1), set an expiration date (optional) (2), assign a role (3), configure permissions (4), and create your token (5):

4. Once created, you can copy the token:

</Steps>

:::note
Make sure you save your token, because it is only displayed once.
