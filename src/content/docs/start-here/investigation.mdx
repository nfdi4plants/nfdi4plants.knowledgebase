<ViolaSays>
Now that I have an ARC, I want to add my data. The investigation file seems to be the most top level. Let's start there!
</ViolaSays>

At the **investigation** level you can record project metadata such as the project title and description, responsible contacts and associated publications.

<ViolaSays>
So no lab work here, just some metadata. Let's see how this works.

<Card icon="pen" title="ARCitect">
  <Steps>

  1. Click on the ARC's name (`AthalianaColdStressSugar`) on top of the file tree.
  2. A panel opening to the right shows the investigation form.
  3. Here you can add metadata about your investigation.

      :::note[Identifier]
      The investigation identifier was automatically added based on your ARC's name.
      :::

  4. ##### Add a Title

      This should be a meaningful project title. Here you can add blanks or special characters.

      <ViolaSays>
        The **Title** of my project is _Arabidopsis thaliana cold acclimation_.
      </ViolaSays>

  4. ##### Add a Description

      Add a concise description about your project. This can be an abstract. 

      <ViolaSays>
        This experiment investigates the response of _Arabidopsis thaliana_ to cold stress by subjecting plants to low-temperature conditions and monitoring physiological, molecular, and growth-related changes. Cold-treated plants are compared with control groups grown under optimal conditions to assess stress-related markers such as changes in protein abundance, sugar content, and growth rates. The goal is to identify key molecules and physiological responses involved in cold tolerance, contributing to the understanding of plant stress adaptation mechanisms.
      </ViolaSays>

  4. ##### Add Contacts

      Add persons responsible for the project. Click on the plus sign in the Contacts section to add a new person. Click the added box to expand it and add the relevant information. 

      <ViolaSays>
        I add my PI *Prof. Jasmine Beetroot*, our collaboration partner *Oliver Sage* and myself, *Viola Canina*, as **Contacts**.
