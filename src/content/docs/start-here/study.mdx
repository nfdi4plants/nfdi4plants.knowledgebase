<ViolaSays>
And where do I add my experimental design? Where can I describe how I grew my plants under different conditions?
</ViolaSays>

With **studies** you can describe materials and resources. In this Violas-PhD-Project you can add the different growth conditions of your plants here.

## Create a new study

<Card icon="pen" title="ARCitect">
  <Steps>

  1. Click on the plus icon <QIcon name="add" /> next to <QIcon name="science" /> `studies` to add a new study.
  2. Enter a name for the `New Study`.

      <ViolaSays>
        AthalianaColdStress
      </ViolaSays>

  3. Click `New Study`.
  4. ARCitect adds the study `AthalianaColdStress` including the folders `protocols` and `resources` as well as a `README.md` and the `isa.study.xlsx` workbook. 
    
      <FileTree>
      - AthalianaColdStressSugar
        - studies
          - **AthalianaColdStress**
            - protocols
              - ...
            - resources
              - ...
            - isa.study.xlsx
            - README.md
        - ...
      </FileTree>

      :::note
      The `isa.study.xlsx` is not displayed inside ARCitect.
      :::

  5. Click on the study's name (`AthalianaColdStress`) in the file tree to edit the study metadata in the right panel.
  6. Here you can add metadata about your study.

      <ViolaSays>
        My **description**: "Cold acclimation analysis of Arabidopsis leaf tissue"
      </ViolaSays>

      :::note
      On the study level, you can add the same type of metadata as on the investigation level in the previous step.
      :::
      
      :::tip
      If you add data from an external source or database, this is a good place to reference the data source or associated publications.
      :::

  </Steps>

## Protocols

<ViolaSays>
  I saved my lab notes about the plant growth in the file growth_protocol.md. Can I store that somewhere?
</ViolaSays>

You can use the protocol subdirectory to store free-text protocols that describe how the samples or materials were created.

![](@images/start-here/arc-prototypic-study-identify.svg)


<Card icon="pen" title="ARCitect">
  <Steps>

  1. Right-click on the `protocols` folder and select `Import Files` from the context menu.

  3. Select the file `growth_protocol.md` from the demo data and click `Open`.
  
      :::note 
      In this example Viola has prepared a Markdown file (.md) as a protocol. 
      Markdown Guide: https://www.markdowntutorial.com/
      

  4. The file is added to your ARC.
    
      <FileTree>
      - AthalianaColdStressSugar
        - studies
          - AthalianaColdStress
            - protocols
              - **growth_protocol.md**
        - ...
      </FileTree>

  5. A click on the protocol's file name opens a text editor in the right panel.

  </Steps>
</Card>


## Add samples to your study

<ViolaSays>
And where do I note down the plants I used?
</ViolaSays>

Structured metadata annotation in the ARC is mostly achieved via spreadsheet tables.

Let us start by adding the samples to the study.

<Card icon="pen" title="ARCitect">
  <Steps>

  1. Click on the study's name (`AthalianaColdStress`) in the file tree.
  2. At the bottom of the right panel, click on the <btn>+</btn> right next to the `Study` sheet.
  3. This adds a new table sheet.
  4. Right-click on sheet’s tab to rename it to plant-growth. 
  4. Click on the **"Add Building Block"** button <Icons.BuildingBlock />
  5. From the dropdown menu in the `Add Building Block` widget:
      - select `Input` -> `Source Name` and click `Add Column`
      - select `Output` -> `Sample Name` and click `Add Column`
  6. At the bottom of the table, type `6` in the text field and click <btn>+</btn> to add six rows to your table.

      <ViolaSays>

      I called my plants: "Cold1", "Cold2", "Cold3" and "RT1", "RT2", "RT3"  
      
      And the leaf samples accordingly: "Cold1_leaf", "Cold2_leaf", "Cold3_leaf" and "RT1_leaf", "RT2_leaf", "RT3_leaf". 

      </ViolaSays>

  7. Add the sample identifiers into the columns `Input[Source Name]` and `Output[Sample Name]`.

      `Input[Source Name]` | `Output[Sample Name]`
      -------------------- |  --------------------
      Cold1                |  Cold1_leaf
      Cold2                |  Cold2_leaf
      Cold3                |  Cold3_leaf
      RT1                  |  RT1_leaf
      RT2                  |  RT2_leaf
      RT3                  |  RT3_leaf

      This means that input "Cold1" results in output "Cold1_leaf".

  </Steps>
</Card>

## Referencing the protocol

In the next step we draw a link between the original protocol and the structured metadata.
We reference the protocol in the annotation table to say:

> Plant "Cold1" results in sample "Cold1_leaf" by applying the protocol to it.


<Card icon="pen" title="ARCitect">
  <Steps>

  1. On top of the annotation table, click <Icons.BuildingBlock />.
  1. From the dropdown menu select `More` -> `ProtocolREF` and click `Add Column`.
  1. On top click <Icons.FilePicker /> to open the `File Picker`.
  1. In the `File Picker` widget, click `Pick Files`.
  2. From the ARC select the file `protocols/growth_protocol.md` and click `Open`.
  1. Select a cell in the `Protocol REF` column and click `Insert file names`.

      `Input[Source Name]` |  `Output[Sample Name]` | `ProtocolREF`
      -------------------- |  --------------------   |  --------------------
      Cold1                |  Cold1_leaf  | protocols/growth_protocol.md 
      Cold2                |  Cold2_leaf  |
      Cold3                |  Cold3_leaf  |
      RT1                  |  RT1_leaf  |
      RT2                  |  RT2_leaf  |
      RT3                  |  RT3_leaf  |
 
  1. To fill the complete column with the same value, right-click on a cell and select `Fill Column`. 

      `Input[Source Name]` |  `Output[Sample Name]` | `ProtocolREF`
      -------------------- |  --------------------   |  --------------------
      Cold1                |  Cold1_leaf  | protocols/growth_protocol.md 
      Cold2                |  Cold2_leaf  | protocols/growth_protocol.md 
      Cold3                |  Cold3_leaf  | protocols/growth_protocol.md 
      RT1                  |  RT1_leaf  | protocols/growth_protocol.md 
      RT2                  |  RT2_leaf  | protocols/growth_protocol.md 
      RT3                  |  RT3_leaf  | protocols/growth_protocol.md 
   
   </Steps>

</Card>

:::tip
While it is recommended to store the protocol in an open format (`.md`, `.txt`, `.docx`, …), everything is possible also an URL to an electronic lab notebook.
:::

<ViolaSays>
But from my understanding this is not really machine readable, right? 
</ViolaSays>

Yes, but it still contains valuable information! As we now can link the protocol to the samples, we can later on use the protocol to extract more information from the samples.

## From free-text protocol to structured metadata

![](@images/start-here/arc-prototypic-study-parameterization.svg)

### Finding the metadata vocabulary and descriptors

The ARC builds on standards and leverages ontologies for metadata annotation. The details are out of the scope of this guide. However, it is good to know that a combination of structural and biological ontologies are combined to semantically structure the metadata.

{/* TODO: explain better or delete */}

import XY from "@images/start-here/arc-prototypic-metadata.svg"

<img src={XY.src} style="width:80%;display: block; margin: 20px" />

<ViolaSays>
So I need to find the important information in my protocol and then add it to the metadata table?
</ViolaSays>

Yes! Imagine ontologies like a vocabulary. You can use them to describe your samples in a standardized way. This makes it easier for others to understand your data.

### Parameterizing the study

import {ParentChild} from '@components/mdx/ParentChild.mdx'

Let us look at the growth protocol and extract the important information.

```md title="growth_protocol.md" {3-6, 8-12}
# Study Name: Growth Protocol for *Arabidopsis thaliana*

## Parameters:
- 200 µmol photons m²/s (200 Einstein)
- Alternating 6°C (cold treatment) and 25°C (control)
- 4 days

## Characteristics:
- *Arabidopsis thaliana*
- Leaf
- Hydroponic culture
- Columbia (Col-0)

...
```

Then we need to put this information into context:

> "*Arabidopsis thaliana*" is a "Characteristic" of the samples, describing its "Organism".

<div class="grid md:grid-cols-2">

  <div class="md:!m-0">
  
  ##### Characteristics [ ]

  - <ParentChild parent="Organism" child="Arabidopsis thaliana"/>
  - <ParentChild parent="Tissue" child="Leaf"/>
  - <ParentChild parent="Growth medium" child="Hydroponic culture"/>
  - <ParentChild parent="Ecotype" child="Columbia"/>
  
  </div>
  <div class="md:!m-0">
  
  ##### Parameters [ ]

  - <ParentChild parent="Growth time" child="4d"/>
  - <ParentChild parent="Light intensity" child="200 µEinstein"/>
  - <ParentChild parent="Temperature" child="6°C / 25°C"/>
  
  </div>

</div>


## Add characteristics

<Card icon="pen" title="ARCitect">
  <Steps>

  1. On top of the annotation table, open the `Add Building Block` widget <Icons.BuildingBlock />.
  1. From the dropdown menu select `Characteristic`. The order of blocks shown below may not correspond to what you see in ARCitect but we will learn how to rearrange columns later.

      <ViolaSays>
        I worked on *Arabidopsis thaliana* plants
      </ViolaSays>

  1. Enter `organism` in the search bar. This search looks for suitable *terms* in the *ontology* database.
  1. Select the Term with the id `OBI:0100026` and click `Add Column`.
  1. In the table, insert values by selecting any cell below `Characteristic [organism]`.
  1. Search for _Arabidopsis thaliana_, select a suitable hit and again fill the complete column with right-click on a cell and select `Fill Column`.

      `Input[Source Name]` | `Characteristic [organism]` | `Output[Sample Name]`
      -------------------- |  --------------------   |  --------------------
      Cold1                |  Arabidopsis thaliana  | Cold1_leaf
      Cold2                |                        | Cold2_leaf
      Cold3                |                        | Cold3_leaf
      RT1                  |                        | RT1_leaf
      RT2                  |                        | RT2_leaf
      RT3                  |                        | RT3_leaf


        <ViolaSays>
        Great, I've got this! 
        Now I can add building blocks for the characteristics "tissue" and "growth medium" and enter the values "leaf" and "hydroponic plant culture media", respectively.
      </ViolaSays>
  </Steps>
</Card>


## Add a parameter with a unit

<ViolaSays>
Parameters works just like Characteristics, right? But they also contain numbers with a unit, how can i add that?
</ViolaSays>

Yes, you are right! Parameters are similar to Characteristics. To use units you can simply select the `Unit` toggle during the `Add building block` step and then insert the value in the table afterwards.

<Card icon="pen" title="ARCitect">
  <Steps>

    1. In the *Building Blocks* widget <Icons.BuildingBlock />, select *Parameter*, search for `growth time`.
    2. Click `Unit` and search for `day` in the adjacent search bar. Select the term with the id "UO:0000033" from the unit ontology (UO).
    3. Click `Add Column`.
    4. In the annotation table, select any cell below `Parameter [growth time]` and add "4".

        :::note
        You can see the numbers being complemented with the associated unit.
        :::

    5. Repeat the steps for the parameter `Light intensity`.

  </Steps>
</Card>


## Add a factor building block

<ViolaSays>
So what do i do with "temperature"? My experiment revolves around this specific parameter.
</ViolaSays>

In this case, you can use a `Factor` building block. Factors are used to describe the experimental conditions that are manipulated in an experiment.

<Card icon="pen" title="ARCitect">
  <Steps>       

    1. In the *Building Blocks* widget <Icons.BuildingBlock />, select *Factor*, search for `temperature day`, select the term with the ID `DPBO:0000007`.        
    2. Check the box for *Unit* and search for `degree celsius` in the adjacent search bar.
    3. Select `UO:0000027`.
    4. Click `Add Column`.
    5. In the annotation table, add "25" vs. "6" degree celsius to the respective samples.

        <div class="overflow-x-auto">
          <div class="min-w-[800px]" > 
          `Input[Source Name]` | `Characteristic [organism]` | `Factor [temperature day]` | `Output[Sample Name]`
          -------------------- |  --------------------       | --------------------          |  --------------------
          Cold1                |  Arabidopsis thaliana       | 6 degree celsius              | Cold1_leaf
          Cold2                |  Arabidopsis thaliana       | 6 degree celsius              | Cold2_leaf
          Cold3                |  Arabidopsis thaliana       | 6 degree celsius              | Cold3_leaf
          RT1                  |  Arabidopsis thaliana       | 25 degree celsius             | RT1_leaf
          RT2                  |  Arabidopsis thaliana       | 25 degree celsius             | RT2_leaf
          RT3                  |  Arabidopsis thaliana       | 25 degree celsius             | RT3_leaf
          </div>
        </div>

  </Steps>
</Card>


## Show ontology information

<Card icon="pen" title="ARCitect">
  <Steps>

    1. You can press `F2` after selecting a table cell or open the context menu with `right click` and open `Details` to view all ontology information stored for this cell. By default, only the term name is shown in the table with an green checkmark indicating that a full ontology term exists.

        <div class="mt-4 p-4 border border-[#e6eff8] rounded-lg max-w-sm">
          <h4 class="font-bold mb-2 block">Term</h4>
          <p>Arabidopsis thaliana</p>
          <p>NCBITaxon</p>
          <p>NCBITaxon:3702</p>
        </div>

        <ViolaSays>
          So if someone needs to look up my species, they will find it in an online ontology database.
        </ViolaSays>

        :::note
        You can see that `Arabidopsis thaliana` was added with id and source ontology.
