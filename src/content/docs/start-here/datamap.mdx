<ViolaSays>
The data file "sugar_result.csv" I added earlier contains multiple columns, but in the assay annotation, I just pointed to the file. Is there a way to specify which column belongs to which sample?
</ViolaSays>

Yes! For this, you can make use of data fragment selectors.

:::note
A data fragment selector is a short text which can be added to a file path to specify a portion of the file. 
:::

There exist various different file formats and each requires its own format for annotating fragments as well. 
In this case, we have a tabular file format, for which our tooling provides help.

## Point into results – Fragment selectors

We will now add fragment selectors to the previously created annotation table to connect our sample to specific data points. 
This way, provenance is persistently tracked. Data scientists down the line will thank you for the increase in machine-actionability.

  <Steps>
  1. In the "SugarMeasurement" assay, open the "Sugar Measurement" table
  2. On top of the annotation table, open the "Data Annotator" tool
  3. Click `Choose a file`, find and select `sugar_result.csv` and click `Open`
  4. On top switch from "autodetect" to "output"
  5. Select only the 6(!) Data columns (`RT_M1`, `RT_M2`, `RT_M3`, `Cold_M1`, `Cold_M2`, `Cold_M3`). These are the direct results of the 6 samples.
  6. Click `Submit`

      Input [Sample Name] | Parameter [...] | Output [Data]          |

      RT1_sugar-ext       | ...             | sugar_result.csv#col=5 |
      RT2_sugar-ext       | ...             | sugar_result.csv#col=6 |
      RT3_sugar-ext       | ...             | sugar_result.csv#col=7 |

      You can find more information about the data column by pressing `F2` after selecting the cell.

## DataMAP: Annotation for the fragment selectors

<ViolaSays>
Wow, this is very verbose, even though it only took a few clicks! And you say data scientists will now finally be content?
</ViolaSays>

Yes, but with a final bit of annotation you might even raise a smile from them. 
Using data fragment selectors in the annotation table, you described the provenance between your samples and your data fragments.

In addition, you can further annotate these data fragments and even those which do not directly originate from any of the samples. 
For example, the column containing the names of the sugars. This annotation is done in the datamap.

:::note
A datamap is a collection of data fragment selectors with additional annotation, meant to aid with parsing and understanding the contents of the file. 
:::

We'll now use the datamap to annotate all columns in the file, even the ones we didn't cover in the annotation table.

  <Steps>

  7. Go back to assay metadata (the sheet named `Assay`)
  8. In the `Datamap` section click `Add Datamap` to add a sheet `Data Map`
  9. Open the `Data Map` table sheet at the bottom
  10. Open the "Data Annotator" tool and select the same file (`sugar_result.csv`) as before.
  11. Click on `Open Annotator` and this time **select all 7 columns** and click `Submit`
  12. From the same file select all 7 columns


      <ViolaSays>
        The first column of my result table "sugar_result.csv" contains the name of the measured sugar, that is the **molecule name**. 
        The other six columns contain the measured data: **molecule count** in mmol / kg. 
      </ViolaSays>

  13. Add the following annotation to describe what the columns in "sugar_result.csv" 
      
      Data	                  | …	  | Explication	    | Unit	                  | Object Type
      ----------------------- | --- | --------------- | ----------------------- | -----------
      sugar_result.csv#col=1	| …	  | molecule name		|                         | string
      sugar_result.csv#col=2	| …	  | molecule count	| Millimole per Kilogram	| Float
      sugar_result.csv#col=3	| …	  | molecule count	| Millimole per Kilogram	| Float
      sugar_result.csv#col=4	| …	  | molecule count	| Millimole per Kilogram	| Float
      sugar_result.csv#col=5	| …	  | molecule count	| Millimole per Kilogram	| Float
      sugar_result.csv#col=6	| …	  | molecule count	| Millimole per Kilogram	| Float
      sugar_result.csv#col=7	| …	  | molecule count	| Millimole per Kilogram	| Float
