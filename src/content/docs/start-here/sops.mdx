        My proteomics assay is a bit more complex. I'm honestly not a proteomics expert and I would not know how to annotate this in detail myself.
        It is based on mass spectrometry and routinely performed at our proteomics facility.

For the proteomics assay, we'll apply standard operating procedures (SOPs) to sample records provided by a proteomics facility.

## Add Proteomics Assays and apply SOPs

Follow the same steps as before to add two assays and sort the available demo data.

### Proteomics – Mass Spectrometry

<Card icon="pen" title="ARCitect">

    <Steps>

    1. Create an assay `Proteomics_MS`.
    2. Import the assay files and folders from the demo data into the assay. Use the "Import Files" and "Import Directories" functions accordingly:
    
    </Steps>
    
    <Mermaid>
        ```mermaid
        flowchart LR
        subgraph d[Demo Data]
            D1@{ shape: docs, label: MS_Raw}
            D2@{ shape: doc, label: AssayTemplate_Proteomics_MS.json}
        end
        subgraph a[ARC]
            A1@{ shape: lin-cyl, label: Proteomics_MS/dataset/}
            A2@{ shape: lin-cyl, label: Proteomics_MS/protocols/}
        end
        D1 --> A1
        D2 --> A2
        classDef sub fill:#FFFFFF,color:#2d3e50,font-size:1.1em;
        class d,a sub;
        classDef item font-size:0.9em;
        class D1,D2,A1,A2 item;
        ```
    </Mermaid>

    Load the data annotation into the respective annotation tables

    <Steps>

    1. Create a new annotation table for the assay `Proteomics_MS`.
    2. In the bottom-right corner click `<` to open a panel on the right.
    3. On top of the panel, navigate to the JSON import tab <Icons.FileImport />.
    4. Select `Assay – ARCtrl`, then click on `Choose File`.
    5. Navigate to and select the file `AssayTemplate_Proteomics_MS.json` and click `open`.
        - Select the "Import Type" `..With Values`
        - Check the `Import` checkbox in the `Assay Metadata` panel
        - Click `Submit`
    
    </Steps>    

</Card>

Your assay now contains top-level metadata in the `Assay` sheet, including the "Measurement Type" and "Technology Type" and "Technology Platform". Furthermore, it includes two sheets called `ProtDigest` and `PeptideMS_Bruker` including the metadata records to describe the two processes of protein digest and the mass spectrometry measurement of peptides, respectively.

<ViolaSays>
    Great, with just a few clicks my assay is complemented with the metadata of the facility's SOP.
    Now, I just need to complement the names of my samples and dataset files in the "Input" and "Output" columns. 
</ViolaSays>




### Proteomics – Data analysis

Repeat the same for the "Proteomics Data Analysis" files.

<Card icon="pen" title="ARCitect">

    <Steps>

    1. Create an assay `Proteomics_DataAnalysis`.
    2. Import the assay files and folders from the demo data into the assay
    3. Create suitable annotation tables and import the data annotation, respectively.
    
    </Steps>
    
    <Mermaid>
        ```mermaid
        flowchart LR
        subgraph d[Demo Data]
            D1@{ shape: doc, label: combined_protein.fasta}
            D2@{ shape: doc, label: MSFraggerOutput/combined_protein.csv}
            D3@{ shape: doc, label: AssayTemplate_Proteomics_DataAnalysis.json}
        end
        subgraph a[ARC]
            A1@{ shape: lin-cyl, label: Proteomics_DataAnalysis/dataset/}
            A2@{ shape: lin-cyl, label: Proteomics_DataAnalysis/protocols/}
        end
        D1 --> A1
        D2 --> A1
        D3 --> A2
        classDef sub fill:#FFFFFF,color:#2d3e50,font-size:1.1em;
        class d,a sub;
        classDef item font-size:0.9em;
        class D1,D2,D3,A1,A2 item;
        ```
    </Mermaid>

</Card>

<ViolaSays>
    Again, I will have to complement the specific "Input" and "Output" columns for the identifiers in my ARC. 
    In this example both these columns are of type "Data", so this assay describes a process where data was processed or analyzed. I want to learn more about this approach.
