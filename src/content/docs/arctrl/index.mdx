`ARCtrl` is a software library for working with ARCs. 

By transpilation from the `F#` source code using [Fable](https://fable.io/), it is not only hosted on `nuget`, but also as a javascript package on `npm` and as a python package on `PyPI`.

Therefore you can use `ARCtrl` either as a `.NET`, `Python` or `Javascript` developer! Yay 🎉

By the way: not only the source code is being transpiled. 
Instead, all **1500** tests are being transpiled and run too. 
This ensures an ever growing reliability of the tool-stack.
