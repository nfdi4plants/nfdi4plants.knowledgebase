## Prerequisites

To get started with using ARCtrl, we first need to make sure some prerequisites are met. 
What these are depends on the programming language you are going to program in. 

In any of the three cases, there are of course a plethora of different ways to setup your environment. These are therefore only suggestions to get started. 


<Tabs syncKey="pl">

{/* FSHARP */}
<TabItem label="FSharp" icon='seti:'>

To use ARCtrl in F# or C#, the [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) needs to be installed. We recommend Version .NET8.0.

</TabItem>


{/* JAVASCRIPT */}
<TabItem label="Javascript" icon='seti:javascript'>

To use ARCtrl in Javascript, [nodejs](https://nodejs.dev/en/download/) needs to be installed. We recommend Version >=22.

Additionally, as an (at the moment still) implicit dependency you need to run

```
npm install @nfdi4plants/exceljs
```
</TabItem>


{/* PYTHON */}
<TabItem label="Python" icon='seti:python'>


To use ARCtrl in Python, [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) needs to be installed. Version >=3.11.x is required.

## Installation

Now you can install the `ARCtrl` package.

<Tabs syncKey="pl">

You can find the .NET package on nuget: 

<a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/ARCtrl/"><img alt="Nuget" src="https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/ARCtrl?logo=nuget&color=%234fb3d9"/></a>

For .NET projects, you can just run

```shell
dotnet add package ARCtrl
```

For working in a script, you can easily reference the ARCtrl package from nuget. 

```fsharp
#r "nuget: ARCtrl"

open ARCtrl
```
</TabItem>

To install in your module, just run

```shell
npm install @nfdi4plants/arctrl
```

You can now import the main `ARC` class in your `js` source file
