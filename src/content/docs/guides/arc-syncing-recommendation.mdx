Here we recommend how to comment and sync the progress of your ARC.

## You have full control

Unlike what you may be used to from common cloud services, none of the ARC tools *automatically* or *passively* syncs your ARC between your computer and the DataHUB. You have to actively sync it. What may appear as a burden &ndash; "*Why do I have to do this myself?*" &ndash; actually grants you full access over what is happening with your ARC. First, it allows you to avoid syncing unwanted changes. For instance, consider adding a large amount of data, that may take some time to upload to the DataHUB. You surely would want to decide yourself when to start the upload. Secondly, it allows you document your ARC's progress step by step. In general, the more you work with your ARC, the more you add or update, annotate or analyze data, the more you will want to make sure these changes are saved. Consider the syncing as a way to backup your project's progress as well as an "undo button".

:::tip
In DataPLANT tools and services, the individual sync steps are called "commit".

## Add a message to communicate your ARC's evolution

We recommend adding a message that shortly summarizes, what you did since you last synced your ARC.
Commit messages can be added via [ARCitect's](/arcitect) commit menu or via [ARC commander](/arc-commander/synchronization).

The following exemplifies Viola's commit messages along with the progress of her ARC:


<Steps>

1. Viola starts a fresh ARC for her project

    <ViolaSays>
      initialized ARC structure
    </ViolaSays>

2. She adds folders for her study and assay

    <ViolaSays>
      added folder structure
    </ViolaSays>

3. She adds raw data to an RNASeq assay

    <ViolaSays>
      added RNAseq dataset
    </ViolaSays>

4. She annotates the dataset using Swate 

    <ViolaSays>
      annotate RNAseq samples
    </ViolaSays>

</Steps>


## Follow your progress in the DataHUB

import DataHUBCommits from '../datahub/datahub-arc-commits.mdx'

<DataHUBCommits />
