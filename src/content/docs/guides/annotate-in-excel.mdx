With the help of an [Excel-Add-In](https://learn.microsoft.com/de-de/office/dev/add-ins/excel/excel-add-ins-overview) you can manage your data, utilizing the [ARC](https://nfdi4plants.github.io/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/core-concepts/arc/) standard, directly in excel, without the necessity to upload it anywhere. 
The functionality the excel-add-in provides are similar to [Swate](https://nfdi4plants.github.io/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/swate/) and the differences will be explained in the different sections of swate.
The excel-add-in will soon be published in the official [Microsoft Excel-Add-Ins Store](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps?product=excel).

## Installation
Currently, we recommend the installation using the [excel-browser version provided by microsoft](https://excel.cloud.microsoft/?wdOrigin=MARKETING.FREE.GO-TO-EXCEL) because the set up is much easier than with a local excel version.
