Your new Annotation might need some adjustments. First, you propably want to change the keytype to be more descriptive for the header. 
By clicking on the blue box, a dropdown opens which lets you determine the keytype such as Characterisics, Factor, Component or Parameter. Under 'more' you can find more descriptives keytypes which are for more general data about the protocol like date, performer, description, type, uri and version.

As a next step, you should consider connecting your added key or terms to ontologies. Implementing ontologies enhances the findability and interoperable aspect of your data by using predefined ontologies with an unique ID.

To do this, just click inside the text field and the built-in search compoenent will search in the database for fitting ontologies. You might change the word a bit to get the best results. The search suggestions can be expanded to see the definitions and the ID of the ontology.
Clicking on an ontology suggestion replaces the term in the text field and a checkmark appears on the right to ensure the use of an ontology.

In the same way, you can add more annotations or complete the metadata in the last created annotation. Added words as key, terms or value shighlights them in the document in different colors.
