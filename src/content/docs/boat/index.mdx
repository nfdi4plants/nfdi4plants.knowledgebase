BOAT (Builder for Ontology Annotation Tables) is a web-based tool to direct assist in creating metadata annotations out of your free text protocols.
If you are new to the environment of DataPLANT tools and [ARCs](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/core-concepts/arc), this tool gives a direct entry into receiving metadata from your experimental processes, which are crucial for an ARC and to take advantage of the opportunities. 
The metadata can be connected with [ontologies](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/fundamentals/ontologies) and an MS Excel and ARC compatible output containing your metadata can be downloaded as XLSX or JSON.
