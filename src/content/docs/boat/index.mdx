BOAT (Builder for Ontology Annotation Tables) is a web-based tool to direct assist in creating metadata annotations out of your free text protocols.
If you are new to the environment of DataPLANT tools and [ARCs](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/core-concepts/arc), this tool gives a direct entry into receiving metadata from your experimental processes, which are crucial for an ARC and to take advantage of the opportunities. 
The metadata can be connected with [ontologies](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/fundamentals/ontologies) and an MS Excel and ARC compatible output containing your metadata can be downloaded as XLSX or JSON.


In this documentation you find information about:

-Uploading a document
-Adding and customizing an annotation
-Preview metadata and subpages
-Downloading the metadata

Besides [Swate](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/swate), which is for a more advanced way of adding and edititng standardized metadata sets directly in a tabular format, BOAT provides a high level of user friendlines and a quick creation of said metadata sets with a minimalistic overview. 
BOAT can be accessed via the most common browsers and lets you directly jump in.
