**Continuous Quality Control (CQC) pipelines** are automated processes that run on every commit to an ARC on the DataHUB. They combine the automatic attachment of the ARC RO-Crate to the commit with optional, user-selected validation steps. Users can specify which validation packages their ARC should be tested against, and the results are displayed as badges on the ARC homepage.

CQC on the DataHUB consist of 4 steps: **(1)** the machine-readable representation (_ARC RO-Crate_) for the commit is created and linked, enabling a plethora of downstream applications. **(2)** The ARC is then queried for whether the user has opted in to validate against any validation package. If **(2)** is the case, a pipeline step is created for each validation package. In these steps, the validation package is executed and results are collected and committed to the ARCs `cqc` branch. Subsequently, **(4)** the validation results from **(3)** are displayed as badges on the ARC homepage.

## ARC Validation Package Registry (AVPR)

The [ARC Validation Package Registry (AVPR)](https://avpr.nfdi4plants.org/packages) is the central DataPLANT service for browsing, submitting, and installing ARC validation packages. The AVPR is a community-driven platform that allows users to share and discover validation packages for their ARCs. It provides an overview containing all metadata about an validation packages, such as authors, summary, and even a full package code preview. Additionally, each package page prominently displays the necessary information to use it in CQC pipelines.

## Use Validation packages in your CQC pipeline

Users can choose to validate against any validation package available on the AVPR. To include a validation package in a PLANTDataHUB CQC pipeline, it has to be referenced in the `validation_packages.yml` file located in the `.arc` directory in the ARC's root directory. The CQC pipeline will then automatically validate the ARC against the selected packages on every commit. The file can be created manually or by DataPLANT tooling such as the [ARCitect](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/arcitect).

A `validation_packages.yml` file includes the following keys and values:

- `arc_specification`: The version of the ARC specification the ARC should be validated against (e.g., `2.0.0-draft`).
- ``validation_packages``: A list of validation packages to use for validation. Each package is specified by its `name` and `version`, which can be retrieved from the AVPR.

Example:

```yaml
arc_specification: 2.0.0-draft
validation_packages:
  - name: invenio
    version: 3.1.0
```
