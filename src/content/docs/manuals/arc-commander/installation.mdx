    - This allows you to start the ARC Commander from any folder
    - **Please make sure that you do not have any blank spaces in your path**  
    
    :::tip
    If you do not have admin rights on the computer, please open the settings "Edit environment variables for your account" (see screen shot above) and follow the same steps.
    :::
4. Navigate to a folder in which you want to initialize an ARC

6. Run the ARC Commander from the CMD by executing `arc`

    :::tip

<Steps>

1. Open a Terminal (Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal)

2. Copy/paste the following commands into your terminal and execute them to (a) download the latest ARC Commander release, (b) change permissions to make the ARC Commander executable and (c) move the ARC Commander program to a location from where it is executable via the terminal:

    First, you need to verify if your machine is using an AMD / x86 processor or ARM processor.

    ```bash
    uname -m
    ```

    This command will return the processor type. If it returns x86_64 , your system is x86. If it returns arm64 , armv7l , or similar, it is ARM.

    For AMD / x86 processors

    ```bash
    curl -LO https://github.com/nfdi4plants/ARCCommander/releases/download/v1.0.0/arc_osx-x64
    chmod a+x ./arc_osx-x64
    mv ./arc_osx-x64 /usr/local/bin/arc
    ```

    For ARM processors

    ```bash
    curl -LO https://github.com/nfdi4plants/ARCCommander/releases/download/v1.0.0/arc_osx-arm64
    chmod a+x ./arc_osx-arm64
    mv ./arc_osx-arm64 /usr/local/bin/arc
    ```

    :::caution
    By moving the ARC commander binary to `/usr/local/bin/` it also becomes available to other users on your machine.
    :::

3. Run ARC Commander from the terminal by executing:

    ```bash
    arc
    ```

4. MacOS security note: On first execution, MacOS will not allow arc to be run. Instead it opens a pop-up:

    ```
    > "arc" cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer
    ```

5. Open the Security Panel in system Preferences (Applications -> System Preferences -> "Security & Privacy") or by executing the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    open "x-apple.systempreferences:com.apple.preference.security"
    ```

    In the "General" tab click the bottom-right button "Allow Anyway" right next to

    ```
    > arc was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer.
    ```

6. Head back to the terminal and execute `arc` again. Another pop-up will ask you to confirm by clicking "Open".

7. Check that arc is properly installed by executing

    ```bash
    arc --version
    ```

    You should see the following or similar message:

    ```
    > Start processing parameterless command.  
    > Start Arc Version  
    > v1.0.0  
    > Done processing command.  
    ```

    :::tip
    A global config file will be created the first time you use the ARC Commander at `~/.config/DataPLANT/ArcCommander/ArcCommander.config`

1. Download the latest ARC Commander release

    ```bash
    wget https://github.com/nfdi4plants/ARCCommander/releases/download/v1.0.0/arc_linux-x64
    ```

2. Make it executable

    ```bash
    chmod u+x arc_linux-x64
    ```

3. Move to suitable place (e.g. in your home directory or to `/home/bin/` to make it accessible for all users)

    ```bash
    if ! [ -d "$HOME/bin" ]; then mkdir "$HOME/bin"; fi # If it does not exist, create a folder `bin` in your home directory. 
    mv arc_linux-x64 $HOME/bin/arc # move executable to that folder
    ```

4. You might have to start a fresh terminal or `source ~/.profile`

5. Test that ARC Commander is properly installed

    ```bash
    arc --version
    ```

    You should see the following or similar message:
