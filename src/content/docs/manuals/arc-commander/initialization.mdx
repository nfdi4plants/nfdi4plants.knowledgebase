{/* <!-- TODO: I would suggest to link this to ARC article rather than explaining the structure here --> */}

- The basic ARC folder structure can be created using `arc init`
  - .arc auxillary arc commander files
  - assays storage for raw data
  - studies storage for your material and external data
  - runs storage for processed data
  - workflows storage for computational workflows

- The flag `--repositoryaddress` (`-r`) followed by the URL + ".git" of a remote repository lets you connect your local ARC with the respective remote repository, e.g.,

{/* <!-- TODO: I would suggest to link a small demo ARC from the DataHUB rather than the empty GitHub repo --> */}

```bash
arc init --repositoryaddress https://github.com/nfdi4plants/ARC.git
```
