Using `arc get -r` followed by a URL + ".git" enables you to clone an already existing ARC as a local repository, e.g.,

```bash
arc get -r https://github.com/nfdi4plants/ARC.git
```

:::tip
Adding a `-n` flag to the get command allows you to download the ARC without large data files, e.g.
```bash 
arc get -n -r https://git.nfdi4plants.org/brilator/Facultative-CAM-in-Talinum
```
:::

:::caution
In previous versions of the ARC Commander, the subcommand `get` allowed you to retrieve information from the ARC, e.g., `arc assay get` or `arc study person get`.  
This function is now available using the command `show`, e.g. `arc assay show` or `arc study person show`.
