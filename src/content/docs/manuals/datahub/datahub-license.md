## Why is a LICENSE important?

Licenses in are essential for defining how others can use, modify, and distribute the code or data within a project. When you create and share an ARC, a license provides the formal framework that protects the data creators’ rights while clarifying the terms of use for the content. For example, some licenses allow free use and modification with few restrictions (like MIT or Apache 2.0), while others may require derivative works to also be open source (such as the GPL). Therefore, a license is crucial for fostering collaboration while ensuring legal protection and clarity for both creators and users.

## Adding a LICENSE to your ARC

In the DataHUB, a license is essentially just a standardized text file. 
To add a `LICENSE` to your ARC

1. navigate to your ARC in the DataHUB,
2. click on "Add LICENSE" on the right sidebar menu(1),
3. use a provided license template or enter the license text.

:::tip
We recommend to use a CC-BY license, which is not offered as a template by DataHUB. For a CC-BY 4.0 license, you can copy the legal code from https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode.txt.

:::note
Remember to sync your local ARC (via ARC Commander or ARCitect) after creating a `LICENSE` file in the DataHUB.
