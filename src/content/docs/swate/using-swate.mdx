We currently offer three options to use Swate

### Option 1: ARCitect

Swate is integrated into [ARCitect](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/arcitect) and will automatically be used when adding metadata to your investigation, studies and assays

- This is **recommended for most users** as it directly integrates with your ARC's metadata

### Option 2: Excel plugin

Swate is available as an [Excel plugin](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/guides/annotate-in-excel).

- This is **recommended for users who prefer using Excel functionality** (e.g. for large amounts of metadata)
- This allows you to directly work on the local ISA metadata workbooks (`isa.investigation.xlsx`, `isa.study.xlsx`, `isa.assay.xlsx`) in your ARC.

### Option 3: Standalone

Swate is offered as a [standalone tool](https://swate-alpha.nfdi4plants.org/) in your browser.

- This allows you to use Swate without any installation
- However, there is no direct communication with your ARC – you have to upload / download the files manually.
- This is recommended **to create and contribute [Swate templates](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/swate/swate-template-contribution)**
