## Add an annotation table

In the "New Table" sheet, you can create an annotation table by adding [building blocks](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/swate/building-blocks). Simply click on the "Create Annotation Table" (<Icons.CreateAnnotationTable />) in the <a href={SwateOverview.src} target="_blank">Sidebar</a> or <a href={SwateOverview.src} target="_blank">Widgets</a>.
Your annotation table should consist of an "Input", multiple descriptive building blocks ("Characteristics", "Parameters", "Components") and an "Output".

To create an annotation table within ARCitect, add a new table to your assay or study by clicking the plus (+) symbol next to your metadata sheet. 
Here, you can build your annotation table by adding [building blocks](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/swate/building-blocks) the same way as in the Swate standalone.

## Add an annotation table

When you have an empty excel sheet or one that already contains an annotation table, you can click "Create Annotation Table" (<Icons.CreateAnnotationTable />) in the <a href={SwateOverview.src} target="_blank">Sidebar</a>.
When the excel sheet contains no annotation table, a new annotation table will be created in the active excel sheet.
When an annotation table already exists in the active excel sheet, a new excel sheet will be created, become active and a new annotation table will be created in that sheet.

The new annotation table will be created in the cell that was selected, when "Create Annotation Table" (<Icons.CreateAnnotationTable />) was clicked.
The newly created annotation table has a size of 1 Input [Source Name] column and row.
