Building Blocks are necessary to sustain ontology information in an [annotation table](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/swate/annotation-table) and are designed to follow the core idea behind the [ISA-Tab](https://isa-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/isatab.html) format, although simplified.

:::tip[Specification]
Check out the ISA-XLSX specification to find out more about the individual building block types and their structure.

## Usage in Swate

Click the "Add Building Block" <a href={SwateOverview.src} target="_blank">Widget</a> or navigate to the "Building Blocks" tab in the <a href={SwateOverview.src} target="_blank">Sidebar</a>.
