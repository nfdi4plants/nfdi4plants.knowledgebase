Utilizing [ARCtrl](https://github.com/nfdi4plants/ARCtrl), Swate supports multiple different import and export formats for JSON. 

## Export

In order to export your file, click on "File Export" (<Icons.FileExport />) in the <a href={SwateOverview.src} target="_blank">Sidebar</a>. Here you can select between different official JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) formats. JSON is a lightweight format for storing and exchanging formats between different systems.

After selecting your desired format you export your file by clicking on the "Download" button. A word of warning here, in Excel you have to create a [top level metadata sheet](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/swate/top-level-metadata) before you can export it.

## Import 

In order to import a file, click on "File Import" (<Icons.FileImport />) in the <a href={SwateOverview.src} target="_blank">Sidebar</a>. For importing a filled Swate table, select the same JSON format that was used for the export. Additionally, you also have to select the fitting [ISA file type](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/core-concepts/isa) that was used for the export. Next, you upload your file and select your desired import options, e.g. annotate to existing table, import with values and so on.
