:::caution
Make sure to close all isa.*.xlsx files before submitting a new command to the command line, as otherwise the information cannot be saved by the ARC Commander.
:::

Each ARC includes an isa.investigation file that serves as central information registry. The ARC’s content as well as global and detailed metadata are listed here. Any study or assay addition performed throughout the ARC’s working life must be registered in the isa.investigation.xlsx.

## `arc i create` (Create Investigation)

```bash title="Creating an investigation"
arc i create
```

will open an editor that asks for basic investigation information to create an ISA-TAB conform Excel file. If arguments are applied with the given command, no editor will open.

:::caution
Avoid using spaces in the identifier. Use underscores and capital letters instead.
:::

:::tip
Suggestion: Use your ARC name (without spaces) as your temporary identifier. 
:::

### `Identifier` (Mandatory)



A identifier or an accession number provided by a repository.

Example: `2021_TestARC05`

### `Title`

A concise name given to the investigation.

Example: `Redox behaviour of yeast mutant M21`

### `Description`

A textual description of the investigation.

```txt title="Example" wrap
M21 lacks in protein P09 and is susceptible to H2O2 Treatment. The molecular and phenotypical responses are studied.
```

### `SubmissionDate`

The date on which the investigation was reported to the repository. Formatted as ISO8601 date ('YYYY-MM-DD')

Example: `2022-12-13`

### `PublicReleaseDate`

The date on which the investigation was released publicly. Formatted as ISO8601 date ('YYYY-MM-DD')

Example: `2022-12-13`

### CLI Flags

Instead of using the editor, the following command can be used.  

```bash wrap
arc investigation create --identifier "2021_TestARC05" --title "Redox behaviour of yeast mutant M21" --description "M21 lacks in protein P09 and is susceptible to H2O2 Treatment. The molecular and phenotypical responses are studied."
```

The isa.investigation.xlsx is added to root directory.

:::tip 
You don't need to fill every row from the beginning, as ARCs are intended as an evolving object that shapes over time.
:::

## `arc i person register` (Registering Persons)

Every person that is involved in the investigation can be registered with personal information using:

```bash title="Registering a person"
arc i person register
```  

:::tip 
If an investigation covers several studies with various groups and persons, it may be beneficial to register corresponding contacts to the investigation and register all study-related persons in each study.
:::

### `LastName` (Mandatory)

The last name of a person associated with the investigation.

Example: `Doe`

### `FirstName` (Mandatory)

The first name of a person associated with the investigation.

Example: `John`

### `ORCID` 

*(not ISA-Tab format, will be added as a comment)*

The ORCID iD of the person.

Example: `XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX`

### `Roles`

Term to classify the role(s) performed by this person in the context of the investigation, which means that the roles reported here need not correspond to roles held withing their affiliated organization. Multiple annotations or values attached to one person can be provided by using a semicolon (`;`) Unicode (U0003+B) as a separator (e.g.: submitter;funder;sponsor). The term can be free text or from, for example, a controlled vocabulary or an ontology. If the latter source is used the Term Accession Number and Term Source REF fields below are required.

Example: `supervisor`

### `RolesTermAccessionNumber`

The accession number from the Term Source associated with the selected term.

### `RolesTermSourceREF`

Identifies the controlled vocabulary or ontology that this term comes from. The Source REF has to match one of the Term Source Names declared in the Ontology Source Reference section. RolesTermSourceREF: e.g. `https://github.com/data2health/contributor-role-ontology`

Example: `CRO`

### CLI Flags

Instead of using the editor, the following command can be used:

```bash wrap
arc i person register -l Doe -f John -m P --email jpdoe@mail.com --phone "+49(0)631 205 3045" --address "Paul-Ehrlich-Straße 23, 67663 Kaiserslautern" --affiliation "Department of M21 Measurements, Technische Universität Kaiserslautern, Germany" --roles "supervisor"
```

optional: You can add with `--orcid XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX` the respective ORCID iD of the person to be registered as a comment (only possible via command line).

## `arc i person list` (Inspect Persons)

```bash
arc i person list
```

## `arc i person get` (Inspect Person)

Get detailed information about a specific perosn.

```bash
arc i person get
```

If no arguments are specified, an editor will request first and last name (mandatory) and optionally mid name initials to print all registered information into the shell.  

## `arc i person edit` (Edit Person)

```bash
arc i person edit
```

If no further arguments are specified an editor opens, that asks for the person that should be edited.
If the person exists, another editor opens with information already known for the respective person. The required values can be edited.

## `arc i person update` (Update Person)

To avoid editor pop ups, instead of `arc i person edit` use `arc i person update`.  

```bash wrap
arc i person update -l Kunze -f Heinz-Rudolf --email hrkunze@mail.com --address "Herzstraße 5, 12345 Musterstadt"
```

## `arc i person unregister` (Remove Person)

A person can be removed from an investigation using: 

```bash
arc i person unregister
```
An editor will request first and last name (mandatory) and optionally mid name initials to unregister the person from the isa.investigation.xlsx.

Instead of using the editor, the following command can be used:

```bash
arc i person unregister -l Doe -f John -m P
```

## `arc i publication register` (Register Publication)

```bash
arc i publication register
```

Investigation publications may be a collection of all study publications or publications that emerge from study publications (reviews/integrating publications).

### `DOI` (Mandatory)

A Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for that publication (where available).

### `Status`

A term describing the status of that publication (i.e. submitted, in preparation, published).

Example: `in preparation`

### `StatusTermAccessionNumber`

The accession number from the Term Source associated with the selected term.

Example: `http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/EFO_0001795`

### `StatusTermSourceREF`

Identifies the controlled vocabulary or ontology that this term comes from. The Source REF has to match one of the Term Source Names declared in the Ontology Source Reference section. The [Experimental Factor Ontology](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/efo) (EFO) is an example for describing the status.

Example: `EFO`

## `arc i publication list` (List Publications)

Registered publications can be listed by:

```bash
arc i publication list
```

## `arc i publication get` (Inspect Publication)

```bash
arc i publication get
```

If no arguments are specified an editor will request the doi to print all registered information into the shell.

## `arc i publication edit` (Edit Publication)

```bash
arc i publication edit
```

If no further arguments are specified an editor opens, that asks for the publication doi that should be edited.

If the publication exists, another editor opens with information already known for the respective publication. The required values can be edited.

## `arc i publication update` (Update Publication)

Instead of using the editor, the following command can be used. To circumvent editor pop ups, not `arc i publication edit`, but `arc i publication update` must be used:

```bash wrap
arc i publication update -d 2021_ARC05_Pub01tmp --title "Review on yeast P09 protein and its involvement in redox susceptibility"
```

## `arc i publication unregister` (Remove Publication)

A publication can be removed from an investigation using:

```bash
arc i publication unregister
```

A editor will request the doi to unregister the publication from the isa.investigation.xlsx.

Instead of using the editor, the following command can be used:  

```bash
arc i publication unregister -d 2021_ARC05_Pub01tmp
```
