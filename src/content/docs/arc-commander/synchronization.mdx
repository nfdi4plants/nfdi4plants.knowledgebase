The command `arc sync` handles multiple operations for your ARC in one step. It will

```bash
arc sync [-m]
```

- track LFS files,
- stage changes,
- commit changes,
- pull changes from the remote repository, and
- push changes from your local repository. 

Using the flag `-m` allows you to add a message to your synchronization, e.g.,

```bash
arc sync -m "addition of proteomics dataset"
```

:::tip
If no commit message is added, the ARC Commander by default adds the commit message "Update" during `arc sync`.
