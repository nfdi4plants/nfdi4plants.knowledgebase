Users have the possibility to export the metadata within the ARC as a JSON file. Using 

```bash
arc export
```

the ARC Commander transfers all metadata from the isa.study.xlsx and isa.assay.xlsx to the isa.investigation.xlsx registry and prints the information to the console in JSON format. To generate a JSON file at the root of the ARC you can use the following:
Currently, this JSON file is identical to the ISA.json.

```bash
arc export > YourFile.json
```
Currently, this JSON file is identical to the ISA.json.


:::caution
Important note: Both ISA-Tab and ISA.json support the `Data File` column. As this object has no factors field, which is essential for describing the experiment, the ARC Commander generates an additional sample object with the same name to store the factors when parsing a line with a data file output. As the mapping from input to output in the process is handled exactly n to n, this also requires a duplication of the input objects resulting in additional list entries.
