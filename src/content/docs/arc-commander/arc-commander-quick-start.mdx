This guide introduces the **ARC Commander**, a command line tool to create, edit and share you ARC.
It requires some experience with the command line (command prompt, shell, terminal,...).

:::tip
Before following this guide, we recommend to explore the [Getting Started guide](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/start-here/) for a more comprehensive overview of ARC concepts and features.

Here we reproduce parts of Viola's example ARC created there. However, the ARC Commander by design does not offer all functions you know from [ARCitect](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/arcitect/).
For metadata annotations you can either work on your ARC in ARCitect as explained in the [Getting Started guide](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/start-here/) or explore the different options of using [Swate](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/swate/).

## Setup

Before using the ARC commander, please install Git, Git-LFS and ARC Commander and setup access to your DataHUB account.

<Steps>

  1. 
      <details>
        <summary>Install and setup Git and Git-LFS</summary>
        <InstallationGit />
      </details>
  
  2. 
      <details>
        <summary>Install ARC Commander</summary>
        <InstallationGit />
      </details>

  3. 
      <details>
        <summary>Register for a DataPLANT account</summary>
        <DataHUBAccount />
      </details>

  4. 
      <details>
        <summary>Setup DataHUB access</summary>
        <Access />
      </details>
      

</Steps>


## Initialize your ARC

<Steps>

  1. Create and navigate to a local folder, which you want to initialize as an ARC, e.g. via file explorer or

      ```bash
      mkdir AthalianaColdStressSugar
      cd AthalianaColdStressSugar
      ```
  
  2. Initialize your ARC by executing

      ```bash
      arc init
      ```

</Steps>

This created the general ARC folder structure:

<NewARC />

## Add investigation metadata

<Steps>
  
  1. Add an investigation identifier (`-i` or `--investigationidentifier`)

      ```bash
      arc investigation update -i AthalianaColdStressSugar
      ```

      :::tip
      Avoid using spaces or special characters in the identifier.
      :::
  
  
  2. Add a Title

      ```bash
      arc investigation --title "Arabidopsis thaliana cold acclimation"
      ```  
  
  3. Add a Description

      ```bash
      arc i --description "This experiment investigates the response of Arabidopsis thaliana to cold stress by subjecting plants to low-temperature conditions and monitoring physiological, molecular, and growth-related changes. Cold-treated plants are compared with control groups grown under optimal conditions to assess stress-related markers such as changes in protein abundance, sugar content, and growth rates. The goal is to identify key molecules and physiological responses involved in cold tolerance, contributing to the understanding of plant stress adaptation mechanisms."
      ```

  4. Add Contacts

      ```bash
      arc i person register -f Jasmine -l Beetroot
      arc i person register -f Oliver -l Sage
      arc i person register -f Viola -l Canina --email viola@plantscience.xyz
      ```

</Steps>


## Add studies and assays

<Steps>

1. Add a study with an identifier (`-s`, `--assayidentifier`)

    ```bash
    arc study add -s AthalianaColdStress
    ```
  
2. Add assays with an identifier (`-a`, `--assay`)

    ```bash
    arc assay add -s AthalianaColdStress -a SugarMeasurement
    arc assay add -s AthalianaColdStress -a Proteomics_MS
    arc assay add -s AthalianaColdStress -a Proteomics_DataAnalysis
    ```

    :::note
    An assay must be linked to a study. If a study does not exist, it will be created automatically in this step.
    :::

</Steps>

The ARC Commander will add subdirectories to the *studies* and *assays* folders. Your ARC should
look similar to this now:

import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<FileTree>
- studies
  - AthalianaColdStress
    - resources
    - protocols
    - **isa.study.xlsx**
  - ...
- assays
  - SugarMeasurement
    - dataset
    - protocols
    - **isa.assay.xlsx**
  - ...
- workflows
  - ...
- runs
  - ...
- isa.investigation.xlsx
</FileTree>


## Sync with the DataHUB

<Steps>

1. Synchronize your ARCs with the DataHUB using the command

      ```bash
      arc sync 
      ```

2. If you did not connect your local ARC with a remote one so far, you can specify the remote address (`-r` or `--remote`) followed by the DataHUB URL, e.g.,

    ```bash
    arc sync -r https://git.nfdi4plants.org/<YourUserName>/<YourARC>
    ```

3. If no ARC exists under the given URL, you can force (`-f` or `--force`) the ARC Commander to create it.

    ```bash
    arc sync -f
    ```

    :::note
    This will prompt an Error `ERROR: GIT: fatal: repository 'https://git.nfdi4plants.org/<YourUserName>/<YourARC>' not found` (Windows) or `ERROR: GIT: fatal: couldn't find remote ref main` (macOS). Don't worry, the ARC is being created at that DataHUB during this step.
    :::

4. Check if the upload was successful by visiting your ARC at the respective URL in your browser.

</Steps>

## What next? 

Here we only introduced the basic functions. After concluding this quickstart, you might want to explore the [ARC Commander manual](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/arc-commander) for a more detailed usage instruction.
