import ViolaSays from '@components/ViolaSays.astro'
import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<ViolaSays>
✔︎ I've added data from elabFTW with the elab2ARC tool 
✔︎ I've shared the ARC with colleagues, so they can explore my findings and contribute.  
</ViolaSays>

The ARC now looks like this:

import ViolasARC2 from '@components/mdx/ViolasARC-checkpoint2.mdx'

<ViolasARC2 />
