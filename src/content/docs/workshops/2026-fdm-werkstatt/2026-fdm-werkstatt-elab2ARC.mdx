<ViolaSays>
I documented some of my protocols and data in the electronic lab notebook eLabFTW! Can I somehow convert the data into a format that can be used in the ARC?
</ViolaSays>

Yes, you can! We developed a browser-based tool bridging elabFTW with ARCs. We will use pre-created entries as an example. 

## Authentification


<Card icon="pen" title="elab2ARC">
    <Steps>

    1. Open the website [elab2ARC](http://nfdi4plants.org/elab2arc) and go to the **Token** tab
    2. Select the eLabFTW instance: DataPLANT  
    3. Click `get a test API key` for the eLabFTW API Key 
    4. Click `get a token` to automatically generate a token for your DataHUB account. 
    5. Click `Save`.
    
    </Steps>
</Card>

Now you authenticated your account and can use the tool to convert your eLabFTW data directly into the ARC. 

<ViolaSays>
I have several eLabFTW entries, some belongs to the study part, some to assays. How can I deal with that? 
</ViolaSays>

The tool gives you the choice to select to which part of the ARC you entries belong. We will first create an example for the **study** part.  

## Add an eLabFTW entry as study

<Card icon="pen" title="elab2ARC">
    <Steps>

    1. Go to the **eLabFTW** tab. Here you can see all demo eLabFTW entries with its metadata. 
    2. Click the `Preview button` of entry *66: Arabidopsis growth protocol* to see the content of the entry. Close it afterwards.
    3. Select the entry *66: Arabidopsis growth protocol* and click `Confirm eLabFTW Selection`. 
    4. In the **ARC** tab you can now see the ARC which we created before. Click `Select study` to define the target folder. This will change the Target Path at the bottom. 
    5. Click `Start Conversion` to start the conversion. The converted data will be directly uploaded to the ARC.
    6. In the Conversion Status window you can see the progress of the conversion. Once it is finished, you can go to `Files Changed in the ARC` and directly open the converted data in the ARC by clicking `click to check the file`. 
        
    </Steps>
</Card>

Now a new study folder with the content of the eLabFTW entry is created in the ARC. The structure of the converted data looks like this:

<ViolasARCElab2ARC1 />

## Add an eLabFTW entry as assay

<Card icon="pen" title="elab2ARC">
    <Steps>

    1. Go back to the **eLabFTW** tab. 
    2. Click the `Preview button` of entry *68: Sugar extraction & measurement* to see the content of the entry. It has also the `sugar.results.csv` file as an attachment. Close it afterwards.
    3. Select the entry *68: Sugar extraction & measurement* and click `Confirm eLabFTW Selection`. 
    4. In the **ARC** tab click `Select assay` to define the target folder. 
    5. Enable LLM Annotation Table this time to automatically extract metadata from the eLabFTW entry and fill it into the isa.assay sheet. 
    5. Click `Start Conversion` to start the conversion. The converted data will be directly uploaded to the ARC.
    6. In the Conversion Status window you can see the LLM Response Stream during the process of the conversion. Once it is finished, you can again go to `Files Changed in the ARC` and directly open the converted data in the ARC by clicking `click to check the file`. 
        
    </Steps>
</Card>
Now a new assay folder with the content of the eLabFTW entry is created. Because the eLabFTW entry contains a file attachment, it is also added to the assays dataset folder. The metadata extracted from the LLM is added to the isa.assay sheet, which we later check in ARCitect. 

<ViolasARCElab2ARC2 />

<ViolaSays>
Thats great! I can easily convert my eLabFTW entries into the ARC and have all the data and metadata together. This will save me a lot of time in the future! 
</ViolaSays>

To get a better understanding of the conversion process, you can check the picture. The tool uses the eLabFTW title as the name of the created study/assay folder in the ARC. The main text of the eLabFTW entry is converted into a markdown file and added to the protocols folder. All attachements of the eLabFTW entry are added to the dataset folder. Low-level administrative metadata of the eLabFTW entry (e.g. creation date, author, etc.) are added to the isa.study or isa.assay sheet. If you enable the LLM Annotation Table, the tool will also extract experimental metadata from the main text of the eLabFTW entry and add it to the isa.study or isa.assay sheet.
