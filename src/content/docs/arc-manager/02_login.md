To be able to use the [ARCmanager](https://nfdi4plants.de/arcmanager/app/index.html), you need to have registered to one of the DataHUBs. Information on the different DataHUBs can be found [here](https://www.nfdi4plants.de/content/datahub.html).

Clicking on the the `DataHUB` button (Fig. 1) brings you to the drop down menu of available DataHUBs. The currently selected DataHUB is shaded in grey (Fig. 2).

At present, there are three different DataHUBs available for managing research data. The DataHUBs "reference" and "federated" are available to all researchers, whereas the TRR356 PlantMicrobe DataHUB is only available for members of this project. Members of the TRR356 project are advised to use this DataHUB.

<!--Collaborators of TRR356 research are welcome to the TRR356 PlantMicrobe DataHUB and will be admitted upon request to (**whose email?**).-->

After selecting a DataHUB that you want to access, click on the `Login` button to begin the login process:

If you are using the ARCmanager for the first time, you will see a window (Fig. 4) asking you to authorize the ARCmanager application to authenticate you and edit files of your projects on your behalf. Use the `Authorize` button to proceed.

For the login process, you are presented with a selection of authentication options. Select one that you have used before in the registration process and enter your credentials (Fig. 5).

Different authentication options can be used for the same DataHUB user, if the logins of the different providers have been merged. This process is mediated by Life Science RI. If you are not presented with the option to merge your identities during the registration of an additional identity via another provider, you will have to get in touch with support@aai.lifescience-ri.eu for merging the identities. "Unmerged" identities will be treated as two different users in the DataHUB. Having different users complicates working with GitLab projects locally on your computer and is not recommended.

After successful login, you see the former lilac `Login` button change to a pink `Logout` button (Fig. 6).

### Session Timer

After logging in, a session timer will display the remaining time left for the current user session. Your most recent activities are stored in this session to ensure proper function of the web service.

When the timer reaches 0:00:00, your current session has expired. To initialize a new session, logout and login again. Make sure to save any forms that you are editing during a session before it expires, otherwise input data may get lost.
