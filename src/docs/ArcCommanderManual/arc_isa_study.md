## Adding a study

> :warning: Make sure to close all isa.*.xlsx files before submitting a new command to the command line, as otherwise the information cannot be saved by the ARC Commander.
  
- An investigation may contain several studies, which in turn can include multiple assays.
- There is no need for a folder structure that represents a study since all data are associated with assays. Studies can be created to group related assays within an investigation. A study consists of a single isa.study.xlsx file, can be created by using `arc s init`.
- An existing study can be registered to the investigation by using `arc s register`.
- To create the isa.study file and afterwards register the new study `arc s add` can be used. This command combines init and register.

> :warning: A study identifier also defines the isa file name, so ensure to avoid special characters!

| Identifier (Mandatory)  | A unique identifier, either a temporary identifier supplied by users or one generated by a repository or other database. For example, it could be an identifier complying with the LSID specification.  | GelBasedProteomicsWT                                                                          |
| Title                   | A concise phrase used to encapsulate the purpose and goal of the study.                                                                                                                                 | Gel-based proteomics of wild type cells                                                       |
| Description             | A textual description of the study, with components such as objective or goals.                                                                                                                         | Study to investigate the proteins of wild type yeast cells under standard growth conditions.  |

If no study identifier is given, a study is created with the assay identifier as study identifier. Instead of using the editor, the following command can be used:  
`arc s add --identifier Test --title "Gel-based proteomics of wild type cells" --description " Study to investigate the proteins of wild type yeast cells under standard growth conditions."`

## Listing and inspecting registered studies

- Registered assays can be listed by `arc s list`.
- To get detailed information about a specific entry use `arc s get`. If no arguments are specified an editor will request a study identifier to print all registered information into the shell.

## Editing study information

- A study can be edited using `arc s edit`.
  - If no further arguments are specified an editor opens, that asks for the study identifier that should be edited.
  - If the study exists, another editor opens with information already known for the respective study. The required values can be edited.
- Instead of using the editor, the following command can be used. To circumvent editor pop ups, not `arc s edit`, but `arc s update` must be used:  
`arc s update --identifier GelBasedProteomicsWT --submissiondate "13.04.2020"`

## Removing a study

- A study can be unregistered from the investigation by using `arc s unregister`.
- A study folder structure can be deleted by using `arc s delete`.
- To both, delete the study folder structure and unregister it from the investigation `arc s remove` can be used.
- Supply a studyidentifier to directly use these commands via command line, i.e.: 
  - `arc s unregister -s <study identifier>`
  - `arc s delete -s <study identifier>`
  - `arc s remove -s <study identifier>`

## Registering persons to a study

- Every person, that is involved in a study can be registered with personal information using `arc s person register`.

- Instead of using the editor, the following command can be used:  
`arc s person register -s GelBasedProteomicsWT -l Doe -f John -m P --email jpdoe@mail.com --phone "+49(0)631 205 3045" --address "Paul-Ehrlich-Straße 23, 67663 Kaiserslautern" --affiliation "Department of M21 Measurements, Technische Universität Kaiserslautern, Germany" --roles "supervisor"`

### Listing and inspecting registered persons

- Registered persons can be listed by `arc s person list`.
- To get detailed information about a specific entry use `arc s person get`. If no arguments are specified an editor will request a study identifier, a first and last name (mandatory) and optionally mid name initials to print all registered information into the shell.

### Editing person information

- A person can be edited using `arc s person edit`.
  - If no further arguments are specified an editor opens, that asks for the person that should be edited.
  - If the person exists, another editor opens with information already known for the respective person. The required values can be edited.
- Instead of using the editor, the following command can be used. To circumvent editor pop ups, not `arc s person edit`, but `arc s person update` must be used:  
`arc s person update -s GelBasedProteomicsWT -l Kunze -f Heinz-Rudolf --email hrkunze@mail.com --address "Herzstraße 5, 12345 Musterstadt"`

### Removing a person

- A person can be removed from a study using `arc s person unregister`. An editor will request the study identifier, first and last name (mandatory) and optionally mid name initials to unregister the person from the study in isa.investigation.xlsx.
- Instead of using the editor, the following command can be used:  
`arc s person unregister -s GelBasedProteomicsWT -l Doe -f John -m P`

## Registering publications to studies

- If studies result in publications, they can be registered to the corresponding study.
- Study publications can be registered by `arc s publication register`.

- Instead of using the editor, the following command can be used:  
`arc s publication register -s GelBasedProteomicsWT -d 2021_ARC05_S01_01tmp --authorlist "John P Doe; Eva Muller" --title "abc"`

### Listing and inspecting registered publications

- Registered publications can be listed by `arc s publication list`.
- To get detailed information about a specific entry use `arc s publication get`. If no arguments are specified an editor will request the study identifier and doi to print all registered information into the shell.

### Editing publication information

- A publication can be edited using `arc s publication edit`.
  - If no further arguments are specified an editor opens, that asks for the study identifier and publication doi that should be edited.
  - If the publication exists, another editor opens with information already known for the respective publication. The required values can be edited.
- Instead of using the editor, the following command can be used. To circumvent editor pop ups, not `arc s publication edit`, but `arc s publication update` must be used:  
`arc s publication update -s "GelBasedProteomicsWT" -d 2021_ARC05_Pub01tmp --title "The peroxisomal Flux-Compensator-Cycle is heavily dependent on P09 accumulation under redox stress.".`

### Removing a publication

- A publication can be removed from a study using `arc s publication unregister`. An editor will request the study identifier and DOI to unregister the publication from the study in the isa.investigation file.
- Instead of using the editor, the following command can be used:  
`arc s publication unregister -s GelBasedProteomicsWT -d 2021_ARC05_Pub01tmp`

## Registering Design Types to Studies

- The design type of your study can be registered using `arc s design register`.
  - If no further arguments are specified an editor opens that asks for a term allowing the classification of the study based on the overall experimental design, e.g cross-over design or parallel group design.
  - Additionally you are asked to supply the accession number from the term source and the Term Source REF if available.
- Instead of using the editor, the following command can be used:
`arc s design register -s "GelBasedProteomicsWT" -d "YourDesignType"`
