Welcome to the DataPLANT knowledge base! ðŸ‘‹

Please navigate via the sidebar on the left to

- explore **fundamental** topics on research data management (RDM) and
- how **DataPLANT implements** these aspects to support plant researchers with RDM tools and services.

## Using the knowledge base

Just like the DataPLANT tools and services, the contents of the knowledge base are frequently updated. Hence we decided against an option to export contents into a "final" format such as PDF and rather invite you to check back again. 

:bulb: If you need to save an article or guide &ndash; e.g. for offline read &ndash; please use your web browser's options to save the page as a PDF or web archive. 

This knowledge base is published under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License][cc-by]. [![CC BY 4.0][cc-by-image]][cc-by]

If you want to find the author(s) of specific content, click the "edit this page" button on the bottom-right and check the "author" section in the table on top.
