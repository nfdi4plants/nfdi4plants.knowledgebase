Welcome to the ARCitect Manual.

ðŸš§ The ARCitect is currently being developed and not completely user-ready, yet. Installation for beta-testing requires an admin account.

Please explore the sections on the left to find guides on

- Installation to use the ARCitect
<!-- - Central Functions to work with your ARC, and
- Functions to fill and work on ISA Metadata within your ARC. -->

:bulb: After installation, please check the ARCitect's help menu for further documentation and guides.

> **Developers**, please check out the [ARCitect GitHub repository](https://github.com/nfdi4plants/ARCitect/).
