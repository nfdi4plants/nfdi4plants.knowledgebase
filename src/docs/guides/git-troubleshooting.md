## About this guide

- This is mostly for data stewards.
- This is not a git tutorial, but rather a small start for troubleshooting.

## Background

Some reasons, why we now sometimes run into git issues

- Over the past years we asked users (e.g. during trainings) to install git with minium required guidance
- Even though more advanced tools (ARCitect) now bring their own git installation, there might still occur interferences with older installations
- There might also be issues of tools (e.g. ARCitect and ARC commander) or different versions of those tools handling git-related tasks a bit differently or more / less strict (e.g. things like `main` as the default branch)
- The current (versions of) tools were not really built for collaboration with many people on one ARC (at least not with default settings from DataHUB side). So common errors are related to merge conflicts (multiple users changing files) and divergent branches (e.g. between local and remote clones of the ARC).
- Some behaviors are simply very use-case or setup specific and will in any case and even with the best tooling require some stewardship

## Debugging

1. (if required) [Install Git](https://git-scm.com) on user machine

    :bulb: check installation via `git --version` in a fresh command line / terminal / powershell window

2. navigate to the ARC in trouble (via one of many options below)

- On macOS: you can drag&drop the ARC folder from Finder into a terminal
- On macOS: right-click ARC folder-->"Services"--> "New Terminal at Folder"
- On windows: open folder via Explorer; type "cmd" or "powershell" into the address field on top of Explorer
- On linux / macOS terminal: `cd path/to/ARC`

3. try some of the git commands and debugging below

:bulb: This is not an exhaustive trouble-shooting list. In most cases git and search machines are your friends. Most Git error messages (displayed in the command line or inside ARCitect) include helpful commands to solve the problem or can easily be searched for in the internet.

## Error messages

error message* | possible reason | possible solution
--- | --- | ---
`remote: HTTP Basic: Access denied`  `fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://git.nfdi4plants.org/UserName/ARCname'` | Your computer is not "linked" to your DataHUB account | [Access Denied](#access-denied)
`error: failed to push some refs to 'https://git.nfdi4plants.org/UserName/ARCname' hint: Your push was rejected due to missing or corrupt local objects.` | You tried to upload LFS-tracked files that are not present on your computer | [Git-LFS](#git-lfs)
`error: failed to push some refs to 'https://git.nfdi4plants.org/UserName/ARCname' hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not have locally.` | Your local ARC is out of sync with the remote. | [ARC not in sync with the DataHUB](#arc-not-in-sync-with-the-datahub)
`ERROR: Can not sync with remote as no remote repository address was specified.` | There is no URL specified for your ARC's remote | [Git remote](#git-remote)
`ERROR: GIT: fatal: repository 'https://git.nfdi4plants.org/UserName/ARCname.git' not found` | The remote URL does not exist | [Git remote](#git-remote)
`ERROR: GIT: fatal: detected dubious ownership` | This is an error typically seen when working on mounted network drives | [Dubious ownership](#dubious-ownership)
`fatal: credential-cache unavailable; no unix socket support` | Likely happens on Windows, if a gitconfig `credential.helper=cache` | Adjust the [Git Credential helper](#git-credential-helper) setting
`fatal: Need to specify how to reconcile divergent branches.` | Your ARC contains multiple branches that progressed independently and need to be merged | Contact a data steward.
`error: unable to create file <path/to/file> : Filename too long` | Likely occurs on Windows, if your ARC is stored in a deeply nested folder, i.e. a folder in a folder in a folder ...| Store the ARC on a higher level.

:bulb: *typically displayed during synchronization via ARCitect (DataHUB Sync --> push / pull) or `arc sync`. Even if ARCitect shows "Complete", it's sometimes worth it to scroll up and see these errors.

## Your two favorite Git commands: status and log

Whenever your asked for ARC support likely related to a git issue, the first thing you want to explore is the state of the ARC.

### git status

To get a good summary of the ARC including

- the branch you are on
- files that were committed since last commit
- files that were modified, but not committed (tracked)
- typically anything buggy

```bash
git status
```

If everything's clear and committed, this should prompt something like
> Your branch is up to date with ...
> nothing to commit, working tree clean

### git log

Now, to compare the status of the local clone vs. that of the remote (i.e. the DataHUB) with a bit more confidence and wording, use

```bash
git log
```

This displays the commit history (messages) of the ARC reverse-chronologically, i.e. top-most = latest.
So if the top commit message of the local ARC is different from the last commit message displayed in the DataHUB, the ARC is out of sync.

If you like it prettier, remember "a dog"...

```bash
git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph
```

Hit <kbd>q</kbd>to close the log.

## Git configuration

The gitconfig is basically the settings and preferences for your git installation. There are three types of gitconfigs. Depending on the tool (ARCitect, ARC Commander) and operating system (macOS, Linux, Windows), different git settings may be received from different config files.

flag | meaning
------- | -------
--global | current user on that computer
--system | system-wide (all users)
--local | current repository (ARC)

The following command lists all configurations and where they originate (--show-origin) from and what there scope is (--show-scope).

```bash
git config --list --show-origin --show-scope
```

:bulb: The output will be different depending on wether you are inside or outside an ARC (git repository).

In order to only show e.g. the global gitconfig use

```bash
git config --global --list
```

Typical settings to explore and trouble-shoot

- the default branch should be: `init.defaultbranch=main`
- `user.name` and `user.email` should be defined
- if users keep being asked for passwords during sync with the DataHUB, they might not store their credentials via a `credential.helper`.

### Changing git config

Editing the respective gitconfig is ideally done via command line (quick internet search helps).
:bulb: One could edit the file (listed in `git config --list --show-origin`) via a text editor. However, this is rather error-prone.

#### Adapt user name and email

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "Your eMail"
```

#### Set main as default branch

```bash
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

#### Git Credential Helper

The gitconfig contains a setting, whether and how to save git credentials on your machine called `credential.helper`.

On Windows, you might run into the error `fatal: credential-cache unavailable; no unix socket support`, if it is set to `credential.helper=cache`. 

This can be solved by either of the following:

1. Remove "credential.helper=cache" via `git config --global --unset credential.helper`.
2. Overwrite the setting with "store" instead of "cache" via `git config --global credential.helper store`.

:bulb: If you use ARC commander, we recommend to use the second approach to keep storing your credentials for DataHUB synchronization. 

## Git remote

For ARCs the "remote" is the DataHUB. The remote address (ARC url) is stored in the git of the local ARC.
Display the URL, to which the local ARC is connected via

```bash
git remote -v
```

### Adding a remote during arc sync

A default remote is usually added by ARC Commander or ARCitect.
If the ARC does not yet exist in the DataHUB, and you created it via ARC Commander and synced it via `arc sync`, you will see this error:

```bash error
ERROR: GIT: fatal: repository 'https://git.nfdi4plants.org/UserName/ARCname.git/' not found 
GIT: warning: redirecting to https://git.nfdi4plants.org/UserName/ARCname.git/
...
GIT: remote: The private project UserName/ARCname was successfully created.  
```

This is not to worry about, the ARC was created in the DataHUB during this process.

If you only see the error `ERROR: GIT: fatal: repository 'https://git.nfdi4plants.org/UserName/ARCname.git/' not found`, but not the following lines mentioning that the ARC was created automatically, make sure to use the "force", i.e. `arc sync --force ...`. 

### Adding a remote via git

If above command does not display any remote, you can add one via

```bash
git remote add origin https://git.nfdi4plants.org/<UserName>/<ARCName>
```

### Editing a remote

You can edit a remote via

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://git.nfdi4plants.org/<UserName>/<ARCName>
```

## Branches

As of now, the DataPLANT tools focus on working on a single branch (`main`).
It can still happen that your ARC has multiple branches e.g. by accident (see `git config` --> `init.defaultbranch`) or because some git-affine collaborator knows how to create them.
To display the branches of the local ARC, use

```bash
git branch
```

:bulb: the current branch is marked with an asterisk (*) to the left

If you also want to display branches that exist on the remote (but not locally), use

```bash
git branch --all
```

## Common issues and error messages

### ARC (files) open in multiple programs

A common source for issues are multiple programs that work on the ARC in parallel.

- In particular, working on the ARC with multiple softwares that have Git integration may lead to confusion. For instance, while you sync the ARC using ARCitect or ARC Commander, the changes may still be displayed as un-committed in VSCode, RStudio, PyCharm or other third-party software.

- Many softwares produce hidden temporary files. By default these files are not shown or synced by the ARCitect or ARC Commander. They might still sometimes lead to confusion, e.g. not being able to commit changes. This is especially the case for office software (Excel, Word, LibreOffice, etc.), where e.g. one of the ISA files (`isa.investigation.xlsx`, `isa.study.xlsx`, `isa.assay.xlsx`) or another office file stored in the ARC may be open. However, also ARCs opened in Windows Explorer or macOS Finder sometimes led to issues.

- Before syncing an ARC, close all ARC-files and Explorer / Finder windows
- Avoid to edit, delete, or move files, while the ARC is being synced to the DataHUB

### ARC not in sync with the DataHUB

Your local ARC is likely out of sync with the remote. This happens, if you or an invited colleague work(s) on the same ARC from a different location (e.g. the DataHUB or another computer). Before working on your ARC, make sure to update the local clone via one of these

- ARCitect --> Versioning --> Pull
- `arc sync`
- `git pull` (-> this would also prompt a message if changes need to be merged)

### Access denied

Sometimes you run into permission issues such as

```bash error
remote: HTTP Basic: Access denied. The provided password or token is incorrect or your account has 2FA enabled and you must use a personal access token instead of a password.
```

```bash error
fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://git.nfdi4plants.org/UserName/ARCName.git/'
```

This is due to missing or outdated DataHUB credentials on your computer.
It usually helps to just retrieve new ones. If not, you might have to remove existing credentials stored on your computer.

#### Authenticate the computer

Option 1: [via ARC Commander](./../ArcCommanderManual/arc_access.html)

Option 2: "by hand"
  1. Login to the [DataHUB](https://git.nfdi4plants.org/)
  2. Create a new [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://git.nfdi4plants.org/-/profile/personal_access_tokens) with scope `api`
  3. Run a git command (e.g. `arc sync`, `git pull`) to trigger being asked for git credentials
     1. Provide your DataHUB username
     2. Use the token instead of your password

#### Delete stored credentials

If (new) authentication alone does not help, you might need to delete existing tokens or passwords first.

1. Run `git config --get-regexp "credential"` to find out whether and where credentials are stored
2. This typically displays one of the following
   > credential.helper store

   > credential.helper osxkeychain (only on macOS)

3. If `credential.helper store` is displayed, the credentials are typically stored in `~/.git-credentials`, a hidden text file stored in the user's home folder. Edit this file and delete the row(s) containing "git.nfdi4plants.org" (`https://<UserName>:<Token>@git.nfdi4plants.org`).

4. On macOS (if `credential.helper osxkeychain` is displayed) open the app "Keychain Access", search and delete passwords for "git.nfdi4plants.org".

### Dubious ownership

The error `ERROR: GIT: fatal: detected dubious ownership` typically occurs when working on a mounted network drive (Fileshare, File Server, NAS). Very simplified: the user on the computer and the owner of the network drive differ and git tries to safe you from working in a folder you do not own.

You can add the path to the ARC to the list of safe directories via the command

```bash
git config --global --add safe.directory %(prefix)///servername/share/path/to/ARC/
```

You can circumvent this error by adding **all directories** to your list of safe directories via the command

```bash
git config --global --add safe.directory *
```

:warning: This might however pose a safety risk. Please read the details here: https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-safedirectory

### Git LFS

[Git LFS](./arc_WorkingWithLargeDataFiles.html) is basically the system in the back to simplify working with git and (ARCs containing) large data files.
ARC commander and ARCitect offer options to download (clone) an ARC without large files; speeding up the process and avoiding waste of data storage, if you are only interested e.g. in the metadata.

If you have downloaded (cloned) an ARC without large files and try to upload it to a new location (i.e. new remote due to a transfer to other user, group, etc.), you will see the following or similar error

```bash error
hint: Your push was rejected due to missing or corrupt local objects.
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://git.nfdi4plants.org/UserName/ARCName.git'
```

In this case you would have to download all LFS objects from the original remote first -> ask a data steward for help.

#### Step-by-step track large file(s) via lfs

Done in small steps plus capturing log

```bash
git lfs track "assays/RNAseq_RawData/dataset/**"  ## Track files via LFS (this adds them to .gitattributes)
git add .gitattributes  ## git track .gitattributes first
git add assays/RNAseq_RawData/dataset/* ## git track the large files

GIT_CURL_VERBOSE=1 GIT_TRACE=1 GIT_TRACE_PACKET=1 git commit -m "add rnaseq files to LFS" -v >> git-commit-LFS.log 2>&1 &
GIT_CURL_VERBOSE=1 GIT_TRACE=1 GIT_TRACE_PACKET=1 git push -v >> git-push-LFS.log 2>&1 &
```

#### Check the status of lfs files


```bash
git lfs status
```

#### List LFS-tracked files

To get a list of LFS-tracked files including the size of the original file, run

```bash
git lfs ls-files -ls
```

This will display the object ID (oid), the relative path to the file and the object size.
The oid is also stored in the pointer file at the file's position.

:bulb: If checked-out and downloaded, a file with an oid `77080c4dc5820ede3e992e8116772ae6ec6ba6096e05df4e49fbb5f0665544b2` would be in the folder `.git/lfs/objects/77/08/`. So the first 4 characters of the OiD are split into two subfolders of `.git/lfs/objects/` (i.e. `/77/08/`).

#### Debug LFS-tracked files

To get a report of all LFS-tracked files including there status, use

```bash
git lfs ls-files -d
```

Amongst others, this report will print for every LFS file, whether it is downloaded (`checkout: true; download: true`) to the local ARC or not (`checkout: false; download: false`).


### Get more log

To help troubleshooting add (some or all) variables `GIT_CURL_VERBOSE=1 GIT_TRACE=1 GIT_TRACE_PACKET=1` before your git command to get more info, e.g.

```bash
GIT_CURL_VERBOSE=1 GIT_TRACE=1 GIT_TRACE_PACKET=1 git push -v >> git-push-LFS.log 2>&1 &
```
