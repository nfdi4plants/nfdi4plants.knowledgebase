### Tutorials

#### Code blocks

Tutorials that guide you on steps using the command line usually include code blocks with one or more lines of code. Code blocks are "copy/paste friendly"
You can copy the following line to your command line and hit enter:

```bash
echo "Hello. I am a code block"
```

#### Variables

Code blocks sometimes include `<variables>` in brackets, that need to be replaced with suitable information (e.g. the name of your folder) before executing in your command line.

:bulb: Make sure to also remove the square brackets `<>`.
