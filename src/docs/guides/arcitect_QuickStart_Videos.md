## About this guide

In this guide we focus on how to use the [ARCitect](./../ARCitect-Manual/index.html) to create your ARC and structure, store and share your data.

## Before we can start

Please make sure

:ballot_box_with_check: The latest version of the [ARCitect](./../ARCitect-Manual/index.html) is installed on your computer  
:ballot_box_with_check: You have a [DataPLANT](https://register.nfdi4plants.org) account  
:bulb: Consider reading about the [ARC](./../implementation/AnnotatedResearchContext.html)

## Preparation

Before creating your own ARC, invest some time to think about the following questions. 

- What is my **investigation**?
- What is my **study**?
- Which **assay** did I perform?
  - What is my (raw) **dataset**?
  - What **protocols** did I use?

:bulb: It might help to have this info ready in a text file. In particular, try to think about useful names (identifiers) for investigation, study and assay.

## Quick overview of the ARCitects GUI layout

In this video you will get a quick overview of the ARCitects GUI layout:

## Initiate the ARC folder structure

In this video you will learn how to use the ARCitect to create a new arc:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UgnXTH0vLic?si=s6fDiTgAIxtx022j" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### Your ARC's name



💡 By default, your ARC's name will be used:

1. for the ARC folder on your machine
2. to create your ARC in the DataHUB at `https://git.nfdi4plants.org/<YourUserName>/<YourARC>` (see next steps)
3. as the identifier for your investigation

💡 Make sure that no ARC exists at  `https://git.nfdi4plants.org/<YourUserName>/<YourARC>`. Otherwise you will sync to that ARC.

💡 Avoid spaces and special characters in your ARC's name

In this video you will see an illustration of the points mentioned:

## Start adding your data to the ARC

Try to place your resources, datasets and protocols for each study and assay in the respective folders.

> :bulb: This part will likely require some iteration. 🗣️ Talk to us.
