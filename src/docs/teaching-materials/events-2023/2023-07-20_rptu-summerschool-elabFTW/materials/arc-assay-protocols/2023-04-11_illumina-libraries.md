# Preparation and Sequencing of Illumina Libraries

RNA integrity, sequencing library, and fragment size were analyzed on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Libraries were prepared using the TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit v2 (Illumina) and quantified with a Qubit 2.0 (Invitrogen). Samples were multiplexed with 12 libraries per lane and sequenced in single-end mode (Rapid Run, 150 bp read length) on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform.
