## Your motivation

some excerpts of your motivational statements

- **organizing** data efficiently
- establish a **stable data management** organization in our group
- generate a lot of data on microscopic images, transcriptomics, and metabolomics - help me and my group **organize** our data
- large-scale RNA-seq datasets - build ARCs based on the **FAIR data principles**
- **structure my data** and paths so I but also another person can find data easily

- making data **openly accessible** will benefit researchers to **collaborate** with others more efficiently
- organize data and make them **accessible** to the CEPLAS community
- I want to improve my data management which will help my future career in the academic
