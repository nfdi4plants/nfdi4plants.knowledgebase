## Moving contents from teaching materials to here (recommendations)

- When adding markdowns (bricks, units) and images (i.e. to `img`), replace `/images/` with `/../img/`.

## git issues

Note, with the many images (and powerpoint files) stored in this repo, the overall size has become rather big leading to issues with `git push`
So far, it helped to increase the postBuffer:

```bash
git config --global http.postBuffer 2097152000
```

## Bricks gallery

There's a "bricks gallery", compiling all available bricks, rendered as html.

In `dotnet fornax watch` mode, navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8080/docs/teaching-materials/_maintenance/bricks-gallery.html

## VS Code Marp Settings

In order to work with the VS Code marp extension (i.e. preview and export slides to pdf, html, etc.), you might want to add the following to the gitignored VSC settings (`.vscode/settings.json`) of this repo:

```
{
  "markdown.marp.themes": [
    "src/docs/teaching-materials/style/dataplant_marp-theme.css",
    "src/docs/teaching-materials/style/dataplant_marp-theme-CMR.css",
    "src/docs/teaching-materials/style/dataplant_marp-theme-Intro.css",
    "src/docs/teaching-materials/style/marp-theme_dataplant-ceplas-ccby"
    
  ],
  "markdown.marp.enableHtml": true,
  "markdown.marp.exportType": "html",
  "markdown.marp.pdf.noteAnnotations": false
}
```
