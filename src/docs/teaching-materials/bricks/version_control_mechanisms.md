# Mechanisms and Types of (file) Version Control

- keep many copies of files on the local storage manually
- manually add initials, dates etc. to file names for tracking & collaboration
- store a limited number of versions, e.g. the last 50
- store versions within a limited time frame, e.g. last month
- full version control (in most cases in off-site or local cloud environments)
