# Connect your local ARC to a remote ARC in the DataHUB

In order to connect your local ARC with a remote ARC, you can specify the remote address with the flag `-r` followed by the URL of the remote ARC

```bash
arc sync -r https://git.nfdi4plants.org/<OwnerOfRepository>/<NameOfRepository>
```

> This step needs to be done only once per machine and ARC.
