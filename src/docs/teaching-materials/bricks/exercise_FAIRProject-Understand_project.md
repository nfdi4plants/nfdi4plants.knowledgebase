# Understand your colleague’s project

1. Go to the shared folder prepared before class
1. Try to identify one experiment that led to results (e.g. a figure in the thesis)
1. What are the samples (e.g. plants, bacteria)?
1. How were the samples prepared (~ materials)?  
1. How was the experiment performed (~ methods)?
1. What is the raw data (~ results)?
1. How was the data analyzed (~ computational methods, statistics)?  
1. Collect all of the above in a `README_<YourArbitraryParticipantID>.txt` in the same folder.
