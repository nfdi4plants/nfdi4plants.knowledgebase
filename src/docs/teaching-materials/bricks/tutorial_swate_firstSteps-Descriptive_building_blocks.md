# Descriptive building blocks

- Use the search field (B) to search for an ontology term for a descriptive building block (Characteristics, Parameter, Factor, or Component)

> Note: Swate accesses the SwateDB with a list of established external ontologies designated suitable for use in plant science. In addition, we feature our own ontology DPBO to extend the DB with missing, but necessary terms.
