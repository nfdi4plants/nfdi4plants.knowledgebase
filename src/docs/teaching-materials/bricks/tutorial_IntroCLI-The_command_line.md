# The command line

Find the **command-line interface (CLI)** on your system.

- On Windows: Enter `powershell` into the explorer path
- On MacOS: Search `terminal` via spotlight (&#8984; + &#9251;) or navigate to `Applications` -> `Utilities` -> `Terminal`

<br>
> Note: In our tutorials we sometimes use "terminal", "command-line interface (CLI)" and "powershell" interchangeably.
