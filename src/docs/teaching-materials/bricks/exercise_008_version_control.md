# Which files need to be "versioned"?

- paper manuscript (.docx)
- single-cell RNASeq reads (.fastq.gz)
- spread sheet with photometer measurements (.xlsx)
- calendar invitation (.ical)
- photo of SDS-PAGE (.jpeg)
- excel workbook with calculations (.xlsx)
- presentation for a conference (.pdf)
- data analysis script (.py)

<!--

## No versioning

- "Raw data" or "original data" > backup and do not touch
- do not calculate anything in measurement excel workbooks

## Versioning

anything that is (frequently) updated
- manuscripts
- calculations
- workflows
- scripts

## Does not matter

things you use and ignore
- calendar invitations
