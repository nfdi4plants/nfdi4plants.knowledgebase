# About this tutorial

The recommended routine to synchronize ARCs is via the ARC Commander

You can use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to synchronize ARCs between the DataHUB and your local machine.

> Note: This authenticates your local GitHub Desktop to communicate with the DataHUB.
> You need to do this only once per machine (unless you specify an expiration date)
