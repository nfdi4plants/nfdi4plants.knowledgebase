# Text editors and IDEs

*Please do not open markdown (.md) files in MS word*

Recommended text editors with code highlighting

- Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>
- BBEdit <https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/>
- Sublime <https://www.sublimetext.com/>

- These highlight the structure / hierarchy of many text / code file types and make them a bit more comprehensible than pure text editors
