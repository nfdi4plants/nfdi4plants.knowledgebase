# Annotate your samples and data <!--fit-->

   
- With the *ontology term search* feature, multiple values can be added simultaneously to your building blocks .
- When *Use related term directed search* is enabled, Swate  suggests suitable terms within the ontology  for the column header, e.g.
*TripleTOF* *5600* for *instrument model.*

# Annotate your samples and data <!--fit-->

- If term-directed search is disabled, Swate still suggests ontology terms, but without relation to the column header.

- If you cannot find a fitting term, use free text input.
