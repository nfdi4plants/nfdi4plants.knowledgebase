# Prerequisites (Participants)
1. Share the data required to reproduce **your BA / MA / PhD thesis**  
2. In the [folder shared for this class](<link to folder>), we have prepared a folder <name of folder> with one subfolder per participant (named Participant01, Participant02, …). We separately send a list of assigned participant IDs via email.
3. Dump everything into your folder that led to the results presented in your bachelor thesis - in the status you left it after finishing your thesis. No worries, you will not be judged. This is just for training purposes.
4. For example: lab methods, materials, sample lists, protocols, measurement data from experiments, analyses, scripts…
5. Do not share the bachelor thesis itself (i.e. the text document).  
6. For data files larger than 50MB (e.g. sequencing or imaging data) please prepare simple placeholders. To do so, just open a text editor (not Word) and store blank files - e.g. store a “sample01.fastq” as a placeholder for a 5 GB sequencing file called sample01.fastq. If you have very many files, do this only for a subset.
7. Try to keep the overall folder size below 300 MB.
