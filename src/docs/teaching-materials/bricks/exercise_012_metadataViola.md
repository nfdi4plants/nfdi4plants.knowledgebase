# Viola's PhD Project

Exercise: Take 5 minutes to note down the metadata

Viola investigates the effect of the plant circadian clock on sugar metabolism in *W. mirabilis*. For her PhD project, which is part of an EU-funded consortium in Prof. Beetroot's lab, she acquires seeds from a South-African botanical society. Viola grows the plants under different light regimes, harvests leaves from a two-day time series experiment, extracts polar metabolites as well as RNA and submits the samples to nearby core facilities for metabolomics and transcriptomics measurements, respectively. After a few weeks of iterative consultation with the facilities' heads as well as technicians and computational biologists involved, Viola receives back a wealth of raw and processed data. From the data she produces figures and wraps everything up to publish the results in the Journal of Wonderful Plant Sciences.

`Viola` investigates the `effect of the plant circadian clock` on `sugar metabolism` in *`W. mirabilis`*. For her `PhD project`, which is part of an `EU-funded consortium` in `Prof. Beetroot's lab`, she acquires `seeds` from a `South-African botanical society`. Viola `grows the plants` under `different light regimes`, harvests `leaves` from a `two-day time series experiment`, extracts `polar metabolites` as well as `RNA` and submits the samples to nearby `core facilities for metabolomics and transcriptomics` measurements, respectively. `After a few weeks` of iterative consultation with the facilities' heads as well as `technicians` and `computational biologists` involved, Viola receives back a wealth of `raw and processed data`. From the data she `produces figures` and wraps everything up to `publish the results in the Journal of Wonderful Plant Sciences`.
