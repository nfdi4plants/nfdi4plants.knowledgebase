### Challenges a user faces in being FAIR

### Here you could address the general problems of the user. FAIRData_ActivationEnergy and FAIRData_ActivationEnergy_withDataPLANT would also be appropriate.
../../bricks/User_Challenges.md

### Here one could elaborate on the ARC structure as deeply as desired. In addition, Swate incl. ontology could be discussed here.

### Here one could elaborate on the ARC structure as deeply as desired. In addition, Swate incl. ontology could be discussed here. Related Unit: lesson_022_ARC_structure_DataPLANT.md
../../bricks/BigPicture_ARC_DataPLANT-1Storage-and-BackUp.md

### Here one could elaborate on the DataHUB as deeply as desired. In addition, the ARC Commander could be introduced here. Related Unit: lesson_026_DataHUB_DataPLANT.md

### Here one could elaborate on the ARC structure as deeply as desired. In addition, Swate incl. ontology could be discussed here. Here one could go into sharing in general and AAI and different roles within the RDM cycle. Related Unit: tutorial_019_datahub_collaboration.md

### Here one could address repositories in general, but also ROC, Galaxy or Invenio.
