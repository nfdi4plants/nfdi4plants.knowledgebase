The DataHUB allows to directly operate files and folders without using any other tools similar to what you are used to from your computer's file explorer or finder.

## Add files or folders

1. From the [ARC panel](./datahub-ARCPanel.html), navigate to subdirectory of your ARC. 
2. Click the plus sign next to your ARC's name (1).
3. Select to upload a file (2) or create a new directory (3) in the current directory. 
4. This will open a new menu where you can upload your file or choose a name for your new directory. 

## Replace, delete or download single files

2. From the next view you can choose to replace (2) a file via upload, delete (3) or download (4) the file.
