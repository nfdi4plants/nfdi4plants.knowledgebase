Every ARC repository comes with its own wiki space. You can create and design the wiki to your personal needs. 

The wiki is directly associated to your ARC and has the same access rights as your ARC. Only those users who can see the content of your ARC, can also see the wiki pages. So it is a good space to share meeting minutes or ideas around the ARC with collaboration partners. 

This is particularly useful to keep the ARC clean of files that are not considered "research data".

To open your ARC's wiki click on **Plan** and then **Wiki** in the sidebar of your [ARC panel](./datahub-ARCPanel.html).
