## Setup

The DataPLANT Knowledge Base is built on [astro starlight](https://starlight.astro.build). Many features not covered here specifically may be found in their docs.

Starlight itself builds on [Astro](https://astro.build). Please check out [their website](https://docs.astro.build/en/install-and-setup/) for detailed installation instructions.

### Installation

1. Install [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Clone the Knowledge Base repository via `git clone https://github.com/nfdi4plants/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase`

### Create content and watch locally

1. Install package dependencies via `npm install`
2. Start the knowledge base in watch mode via `npm run dev`

### Check for dead links

Especially when moving or cross-linking files (other articles or images), make sure to test-build the site via `npm run build`! This validates all links.

### Markdown

All articles are written in markdown (.md or .mdx).
See https://starlight.astro.build/guides/authoring-content/ for a short introduction.

### VSCode

We recommend working with VSCode to generate content.

Recommended VSCode extensions:

- Astro Build: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=astro-build.astro-vscode
- MDX: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx

ðŸ’¡ The mdx files cannot be previewed in VSCode. Please use `npm run dev` as described above.

## Where should I place my content?

### Start here

This is a place for content required for the recommended way to work with an ARC.

### Core Concepts

DataPLANT and ARC core concepts, design decisions, etc. 

### Guides

Here you can place content for a specific topic or task. Do not place specific tools documentation here.

### `<specific-tool>`

If you have a tool that is used in the context of an ARC, you can place the documentation here.

### Fundamentals

Basic information about RDM, not necessary ARC related.

## Authorship

Authors listed via a file in [`src/content/authors`](src/content/authors) can easily be mentioned in the yaml header of articles. 

For example `src/content/authors/kevin-frey.yml`:

```yaml
name: Kevin Frey
image: "@images/authors/kevin-frey.jpg"
socials:
  - icon: simple-icons:github
    href: https://github.com/Freymaurer
  - icon: simple-icons:orcid
    href: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8510-6810
affiliation: DataPLANT
styling:
  text: KFR
```

The author is linked simply via yaml article metadata

```yaml
authors:
  - kevin-frey
```

## Style Guide


All files and folders must always be [kebap-case](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Kebab_case). This means all lower case and `-` as word separator.

```txt title="Example"
src\assets\images\arc-commander\access-2.png
```


## Composition

Always follow **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principle. If you have the same content in multiple places, consider creating a reusable component.

In `.mdx` you can not only link to other content, but also directly insert other content in the current file.


### Use Starlight components

The Starlight framework has some nice components that can be used in the `.mdx` files.

Have an eye on the existing components to improve the readability of the content.

[Starlight components](https://starlight.astro.build/components/using-components/)

### Use Custom components

Checkout the `src/components/mdx` directory for custom components.

Can only be used in mdx files.

#### Mermaid

```mdx
import Mermaid from '@components/mdx/Mermaid.astro'

<Mermaid>
```mermaid
flowchart LR
    markdown["`This **is** _Markdown_`"]
    newLines["`Line1
    Line 2
    Line 3`"]
    markdown --> newLines
```
</Mermaid>
```

#### Viola Says

```mdx
import ViolaSays from '@components/ViolaSays.astro'

<ViolaSays>
Ok, I think I understand. The study is used to describe the overall experiment and the sample generation. Then the assays are used to describe the individual lab processes and the data generation!
</ViolaSays>
```

#### File Trees

Example file trees can be generated with the FileTree component, e.g.

```mdx
import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

<FileTree>
- assays
    - **SugarMeasurement**
        - dataset
            - ...
        - protocols
            - ...
        - isa.assay.xlsx
        - README.md
    - ...
</FileTree>
```

The file tree of an empty ARC is available in `components/mdx/BaseARC.mdx` and can directly be included via

```mdx
import BaseARC from '@components/mdx/BaseARC.mdx';

<BaseARC />
```


#### Use Swate Icons and other components

To avoid having to describe Swate features, some Swate icons and widgets are now available as components.

##### Icons

```js
import Icons from '@components/swate/Icons';

<Icons.BuildingBlock />
<Icons.FilePicker />
<Icons.FileImport />
<Icons.BuildingBlock />
<Icons.FilePicker />
<Icons.DataAnnotator />
<Icons.FileImport />
<Icons.FileExport />
<Icons.Terms />
<Icons.Templates />
<Icons.Settings />
<Icons.About />
<Icons.PrivacyPolicy />
<Icons.Docs />
<Icons.Contact />
<Icons.Save />
<Icons.Delete />
<Icons.Forward />
<Icons.Backward />
<Icons.BuildingBlockInformation />
<Icons.RemoveBuildingBlock />
<Icons.AutoformatTable />
<Icons.CreateAnnotationTable />
<Icons.CreateMetadata />
<Icons.Back />
```

##### Term Search

```js
import TermSearch from '@components/swate/TermSearch';

<TermSearch name={"Test"} parentId={"MS:1000031"} showTerm client:only="react"/>

```

### Images

#### How to store

Try to use `.svg` files for icons, graphics and logos. Use any other file format for screenshots or tutorial images.

Images should be stored in the `src/assets/images` directory. If your image has a obvious context, you SHOULD create a subdirectory for it. 

```txt title="Example"
src
|-- assets
    |-- images
        |-- arc-commander
            |-- access-1.png
            |-- access-2.png
            |-- access-3.png
```

#### Use in `.md`/`.mdx`

Two options to insert images.

In markdown you can use the following syntax:

```md
![Alt text](@images/path/to/image.png)
```

For html in `.mdx` you can use the following syntax:

```mdx
import MacOSSecurity from "@images/arcitect/macos-security.png"

<img src={MacOSSecurity.src} style="width:50%;display: block; margin: 20px" />
```

### html

Try to avoid html as it will usually override the consistent page design.  
**Don't use `<br />`!**

If you really need some special design or styling, raise an issue or contact the main contributors to discuss.

### Tables

Tables as summary for content MUST be avoided!

Tables may be used to show an example Annotation Table or to compare small information sets.

### Lists

Do not use lists for content. Lists are only allowed for navigation or short information sequences.

<details>
<summary>Good example:</summary>

```md
Please explore the sections on the left to find guides on:

- adding building blocks to your annotation table
- filling cells with ontology terms
- using and creating templates
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Bad example:</summary>

```md
### Addition of assays

- An assay may consist of experimentally measured data together with experimental protocols.
- An assay folder structure can be created by using `arc a init`. Under assays an assay folder named after the assay identifier is created which includes:
  - dataset
  - protocol
  - assay.isa.xlsx
  - README.md
- An existing assay can be registered to the investigation by using `arc a register`.
- To create the folder structure and afterwards register the new assay `arc a add` can be used. This command combines init and register.
```
</details>

### Article cross-references

Avoid relative paths when cross-referencing another knowledge base article.
Instead, use references starting from the `docs` folder as root and add `/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/`, e.g.

```md
[wiki associated to the ARC](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/datahub/datahub-arc-wiki)
```

### Using tabs

#### Multilingual code

Some software libraries of the DataPLANT ecosystem are transpiled and can be accessed from three different programming languages: 
  - FSharp
  - JavaScript
  - Python

In cases where this applies, it is recommended to present code snippets in the documentation by making use of `Tab` components.

First start out by importing the components at the top of your `mdx` file:

```js
import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
```

Then for multilanguage code blocks use the following structure:

```html
<Tabs syncKey="pl">

<TabItem label="FSharp" icon='seti:f-sharp'>
// Your F# documentation here
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="JavaScript" icon='seti:javascript'>
// Your JS documentation here
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Python" icon='seti:python'>
// Your Py documentation here
</TabItem>

</Tabs>
```

Make sure the `syncKey` is always `"pl"` (programming language), and the labels are written exactly as `FSharp`, `JavaScript` and `Python`.


### ARC Representation

The ARC metadata comes in [two representations](https://arc-rdm.org/details/arc-representation/): json (RO-Crate) and tabular (scaffold).
To showcase these representations for different users (coders: json, biologists: table), you can use the `Tab` component and icons `seti:json` and `seti:xls`.

```html
<Tabs syncKey="arc-dual-view">

<TabItem label="Tabular View" icon="seti:xls">

// tabular or scaffold example

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="ARCtrl.json" icon="seti:json">

// json example

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```
