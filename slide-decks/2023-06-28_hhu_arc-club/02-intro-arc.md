# The ARC Club

Day 1 &ndash; Into the ARC

Dominik Brilhaus &ndash; CEPLAS Data Science
August 16th, 2023

# ARC Club Goals

- Move existing datasets into ARCs
- Share them via the DataHUB
- First few steps into ARCs
- Data users can pick them up from there

---

# Rules: perfect is the enemy of good

- There is no perfect ARC
- There is no complete ARC
- The only bad ARCs are those that don't exist yet.

<br>

:rocket: Let's get started, the rest is easy :rocket:
