# Treatments and harvest of leaf material

Two mature and fully illuminated  leaves  of  each  plant  were  treated  either  with  (+/–)  ABA  [Sigma-Aldrich; 200 μM solution in 0.095% (v/v) methanol] or mock solution (0.095% (v/v) methanol). Both solutions contained 0.02% (v/v) Tween-20 (PanReac AppliChem). The first treatment took place after 4 hours in the light and the second treatment followed 4 hours later (Fig. 1). Treated leaves were harvested and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen 40, 80, 160, 320, 640,  and  1280  min  after  the  first  treatment.  Two  biological  replicates  originating from two independent plants were harvested per time point. The treated leaves from the same plant were pooled prior to all analyses.
